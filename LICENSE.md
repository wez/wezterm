WezTerm bundles `JetBrains Mono`, `Noto Color Emoji` and `Roboto` fonts.
Those are distributed under the terms of the OFL 1.1, the text of which
can be found in the assets/fonts directory.

WezTerm bundles `Symbols Nerd Font Mono`, built from only those icon sets
available from https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts which are clearly
distributed under the terms of the OFL 1.1.
Note that WezTerm excludes the Pomicons icon set from this collection.
