# varbincode

varbincode is a binary serialization format that uses variable
length encoding for integer values, which typically results in
reduced size of the encoded data.

It is losely based on `bincode` which is offered under an MIT
license (same as the wezterm crate from which `varbincode`
originates) and is Copyright 2014 Ty Overby.
