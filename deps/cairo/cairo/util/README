Cairo Utilities
===============

There are a varieties of utilities we use with cairo.


malloc-stats
------------

This is a small shared library designed to be preloaded by the
linker and its purpose is to make the malloc_stats() function
of glibc produce more useful information.

Build by:

	make malloc-stats.so

and use by:

	LD_PRELOAD=$(blddir)/util/libmalloc-stats.so app-to-run

cairo-trace
-----------

This tool can be used to trace all the cairo function calls made by an
applications.  This is useful for either extracting a test case triggering
a bug from an application, or simply to get a general idea of how an
application is using cairo.


cairo-api-update and xr2cairo
-----------------------------

These two scripts were used to convert source code written for pre-1.0
cairo to newer API.  See $(top_srcdir)/PORTING_GUIDE for more information.

These files are obsolete now and may be removed in a future version.


cairo-view and waterfall
------------------------

These are two pycairo scripts useful for testing the toy font backend.
