/* Compare two slopes. Slope angles begin at 0 in the direction of the
   positive X axis and increase in the direction of the positive Y
   axis.

   This function always compares the slope vectors based on the
   smaller angular difference between them, (that is based on an
   angular difference that is strictly less than pi). To break ties
   when comparing slope vectors with an angular difference of exactly
   pi, the vector with a positive dx (or positive dy if dx's are zero)
   is considered to be more positive than the other.

   Also, all slope vectors with both dx==0 and dy==0 are considered
   equal and more positive than any non-zero vector.

   <  0 => a less positive than b
   == 0 => a equal to b
   >  0 => a more positive than b
