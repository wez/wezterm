/* A #cairo_paginated_surface_t provides a very convenient wrapper that
 * is well-suited for doing the analysis common to most surfaces that
 * have paginated output, (that is, things directed at printers, or
 * for saving content in files such as PostScript or PDF files).
 *
 * To use the paginated surface, you'll first need to create your
 * 'real' surface using _cairo_surface_init() and the standard
 * #cairo_surface_backend_t. Then you also call
 * _cairo_paginated_surface_create which takes its own, much simpler,
 * #cairo_paginated_surface_backend_t. You are free to return the result
 * of _cairo_paginated_surface_create() from your public
 * cairo_<foo>_surface_create(). The paginated backend will be careful
 * to not let the user see that they really got a "wrapped"
 * surface. See test-paginated-surface.c for a fairly minimal example
 * of a paginated-using surface. That should be a reasonable example
 * to follow.
 *
 * What the paginated surface does is first save all drawing
 * operations for a page into a recording-surface. Then when the user calls
 * cairo_show_page(), the paginated surface performs the following
 * sequence of operations (using the backend functions passed to
 * cairo_paginated_surface_create()):
 *
 * 1. Calls start_page() (if not %NULL). At this point, it is appropriate
 *    for the target to emit any page-specific header information into
 *    its output.
 *
 * 2. Calls set_paginated_mode() with an argument of %CAIRO_PAGINATED_MODE_ANALYZE
 *
 * 3. Replays the recording-surface to the target surface, (with an
 *    analysis surface inserted between which watches the return value
 *    from each operation). This analysis stage is used to decide which
 *    operations will require fallbacks.
 *
 * 4. Calls set_bounding_box() to provide the target surface with the
 *    tight bounding box of the page.
 *
 * 5. Calls set_paginated_mode() with an argument of %CAIRO_PAGINATED_MODE_RENDER
 *
 * 6. Replays a subset of the recording-surface operations to the target surface
 *
 * 7. Calls set_paginated_mode() with an argument of %CAIRO_PAGINATED_MODE_FALLBACK
 *
 * 8. Replays the remaining operations to an image surface, sets an
 *    appropriate clip on the target, then paints the resulting image
 *    surface to the target.
 *
 * So, the target will see drawing operations during three separate
 * stages, (ANALYZE, RENDER and FALLBACK). During the ANALYZE phase
 * the target should not actually perform any rendering, (for example,
 * if performing output to a file, no output should be generated
 * during this stage). Instead the drawing functions simply need to
 * return %CAIRO_STATUS_SUCCESS or %CAIRO_INT_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED to
 * indicate whether rendering would be supported. And it should do
 * this as quickly as possible. The FALLBACK phase allows the surface
 * to distinguish fallback images from native rendering in case they
 * need to be handled as a special case.
 *
 * Note: The paginated surface layer assumes that the target surface
 * is "blank" by default at the beginning of each page, without any
 * need for an explicit erase operation, (as opposed to an image
 * surface, for example, which might have uninitialized content
 * originally). As such, it optimizes away CLEAR operations that
 * happen at the beginning of each page---the target surface will not
 * even see these operations.
