/**
 * _cairo_error:
 * @status: a status value indicating an error, (eg. not
 * %CAIRO_STATUS_SUCCESS)
 *
 * Checks that status is an error status, but does nothing else.
 *
 * All assignments of an error status to any user-visible object
 * within the cairo application should result in a call to
 * _cairo_error().
 *
 * The purpose of this function is to allow the user to set a
 * breakpoint in _cairo_error() to generate a stack trace for when the
 * user causes cairo to detect an error.
 *
 * Return value: the error status.
