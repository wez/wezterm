 * Coefficient of the linear approximation (minimizing square difference)

 *   f(w,d) = 2 * integrate (sqrt (w*w/4 - x*x), x, -d/2, d/2)
 * The square difference to a generic linear approximation (c*d) in the range (0,w) would be:
 *   integrate ((f(w,d) - c*d)^2, d, 0, w)
 * To minimize this difference it is sufficient to find a solution of the differential with
 * respect to c:
 *   solve ( diff (integrate ((f(w,d) - c*d)^2, d, 0, w), c), c)
 * Which leads to c = 9/32*pi*w
 * Since we're not interested in the true area, but just in a coverage estimate,
 * we always divide the real area by the line width (w).
 * The same computation for square caps would be
 *   f(w,d) = 2 * integrate(w/2, x, -d/2, d/2)
 *   c = 1*w
 * but in this case it would not be an approximation, since f is already linear in d.
