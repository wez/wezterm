//! This crate provides a cross platform API for working with the
//! psuedo terminal (pty) interfaces provided by the system.
//! Unlike other crates in this space, this crate provides a set
//! of traits that allow selecting from different implementations
//! at runtime.
//! This crate is part of [wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm).
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use portable_pty::{CommandBuilder, PtySize, native_pty_system, PtySystem};
//! use anyhow::Error;
//!
//! // Use the native pty implementation for the system
//! let pty_system = native_pty_system();
//!
//! // Create a new pty
//! let mut pair = pty_system.openpty(PtySize {
//!     rows: 24,
//!     cols: 80,
//!     // Not all systems support pixel_width, pixel_height,
//!     // but it is good practice to set it to something
//!     // that matches the size of the selected font.  That
//!     // is more complex than can be shown here in this
//!     // brief example though!
//!     pixel_width: 0,
//!     pixel_height: 0,
//! })?;
//!
//! // Spawn a shell into the pty
//! let cmd = CommandBuilder::new("bash");
//! let child = pair.slave.spawn_command(cmd)?;
//!
//! // Read and parse output from the pty with reader
//! let mut reader = pair.master.try_clone_reader()?;
//!
//! // Send data to the pty by writing to the master
//! writeln!(pair.master, "ls -l\r\n")?;
//! # Ok::<(), Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! ## ssh2
//!
//! If the `ssh` feature is enabled, this crate exposes an
//! `ssh::SshSession` type that can wrap an established ssh
//! session with an implementation of `PtySystem`, allowing
//! you to use the same pty interface with remote ptys.
