#
# Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph Property
#
# This file is an informative contributory data file in the
# Unicode Character Database.
#
# This data file lists characters that have the Bidi_Mirrored=Yes property
# value, for which there is another Unicode character that typically has a glyph
# that is the mirror image of the original character's glyph.
#
# The repertoire covered by the file is Unicode 14.0.0.
#
# The file contains a list of lines with mappings from one code point
# to another one for character-based mirroring.
# Note that for "real" mirroring, a rendering engine needs to select
# appropriate alternative glyphs, and that many Unicode characters do not
# have a mirror-image Unicode character.
#
# Each mapping line contains two fields, separated by a semicolon (';').
# Each of the two fields contains a code point represented as a
# variable-length hexadecimal value with 4 to 6 digits.
# A comment indicates where the characters are "BEST FIT" mirroring.
#
# Code points for which Bidi_Mirrored=Yes, but for which no appropriate
# characters exist with mirrored glyphs, are
# listed as comments at the end of the file.
#
# Formally, the default value of the Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph property
# for each code point is <none>, unless a mapping to
# some other character is specified in this data file. When a code
# point has the default value for the Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph property,
# that means that no other character exists whose glyph is suitable
# for character-based mirroring.
#
# For information on bidi mirroring, see UAX #9: Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm,
# at https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/
#
# This file was originally created by Markus Scherer.
# Extended for Unicode 3.2, 4.0, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, and 6.0 by Ken Whistler,
# and for subsequent versions by Ken Whistler, Laurentiu Iancu, and Roozbeh Pournader.
#
# Historical and Compatibility Information:
#
# The OpenType Mirroring Pairs List (OMPL) is frozen to match the
# Unicode 5.1 version of the Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph property (2008).
# See https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/ompl.txt
#
# The Unicode 6.1 version of the Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph property (2011)
# added one mirroring pair: 27CB <--> 27CD.
#
# The Unicode 11.0 version of the Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph property (2018)
# underwent a substantial revision, to formally recognize all of the
# exact mirroring pairs and "BEST FIT" mirroring pairs that had been
# added after the freezing of the OMPL list. As a result, starting
# with Unicode 11.0, the bmg mapping values more accurately reflect
# the current status of glyphs for Bidi_Mirrored characters in
# the Unicode Standard, but this listing now extends significantly
# beyond the frozen OMPL list. Implementers should be aware of this
# intentional distinction.
