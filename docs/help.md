## Getting Help

This is a spare time project, so please bear with me.  There are a couple of channels for support:

* You can use the GitHub issue tracker to see if someone else has a similar issue, or to file a new one: <https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues>
* Start or join a thread in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/discussions); if you have general
  questions or want to chat with other wezterm users, you're welcome here!
* There is a [Matrix room via Element.io](https://app.element.io/#/room/#wezterm:matrix.org)
  for (potentially!) real time discussions.

The GitHub Discussions and Element/Gitter rooms are better suited to questions
than it is to bug reports, but don't be afraid to use whichever you are most
comfortable using and we'll work it out.
