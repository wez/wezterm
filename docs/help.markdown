## Getting Help

This is a spare time project, so please bear with me.  There are two channels for support:

* You can use the GitHub issue tracker to see if someone else has a similar issue, or to file a new one: <https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues>
* There is a
  [Matrix/Riot.im](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#gitter_wezterm=2Flobby:matrix.org)
  room for (potentially!) real time discussions; that is bridged from the
  original [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/wezterm/Lobby).

The Matrix/Gitter room is probably better suited to questions than it is to bug
reports, but don't be afraid to use whichever you are most comfortable using
and we'll work it out.
