## Installing on macOS

The CI system builds the package on macOS Mojave (10.14).  It may run on earlier
versions of macOS, but that has not been tested.

If you have an M1-based mac then it is recommended that you download the
Nightly build which is a Universal binary with support for both Apple Silicon
and Intel hardware.

   the application that your just downloaded from the internet.
3. Subsequently, a simple double-click will launch the UI

## Homebrew

WezTerm is available for [brew](https://brew.sh/) users in a tap:

```bash
$ brew tap wez/wezterm
$ brew install wezterm
```

If you'd like to use a nightly build you can perform a head install:

```bash
$ brew install --HEAD wezterm
```

to upgrade to a newer nightly, it is simplest to remove then
install:

```bash
$ brew rm wezterm
$ brew install --HEAD wezterm
```
