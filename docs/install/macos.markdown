## Installing on macOS

The CI system builds the package on macOS Big Sur and should run on systems as
"old" as Mojave.  It may run on earlier versions of macOS, but that has not
been tested.

Starting with version 20210203-095643-70a364eb, WezTerm is a Universal binary
with support for both Apple Silicon and Intel hardware.

1. Download <a href="{{ macos_zip_stable }}">Release</a>
2. Extract the zipfile and drag the `WezTerm.app` bundle to your `Applications` folder
3. First time around, you may need to right click and select `Open` to allow launching
   the application that your just downloaded from the internet.
3. Subsequently, a simple double-click will launch the UI
4. To use wezterm binary from a terminal emulator, like `wezterm ls-fonts` you'll need to add the location to the wezterm binary folder that exists _inside_ the WezTerm.app, to your environment's $PATH value. For example, to add it to your `~/.zshrc` file, and assuming your WezTerm.app was installed to `/Applications`, add:
```sh
PATH="$PATH:/Applications/WezTerm.app/Contents/MacOS"
export PATH
```
5. Configuration instructions can be [found here](../config/files.html)

## Homebrew

WezTerm is available for [brew](https://brew.sh/) users in a tap:

```bash
$ brew tap wez/wezterm
$ brew install --cask wez/wezterm/wezterm
```

If you'd like to use a nightly build:

```bash
$ brew install --cask wez/wezterm/wezterm-nightly
```

to upgrade to a newer nightly (normal `brew upgrade` will not upgrade it!):

```bash
$ brew upgrade --cask wezterm-nightly --no-quarantine --greedy-latest
```

## MacPorts

WezTerm is also available via [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/wezterm/summary):

```bash
$ sudo port selfupdate
$ sudo port install wezterm
```
