## Installing on NetBSD

WezTerm is available [from pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.se/x11/wezterm).

The most common NetBSD architectures have pre-built binaries which you can install via:

```bash
$ pkgin install wezterm
```

The version available in ports is not directly managed by the release
automation of the WezTerm project and may lag behind the latest release.  If
you need to run a newer version, then the [build from source](source.md)
instructions also apply to NetBSD.
