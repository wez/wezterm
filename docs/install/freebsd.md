## Installing on FreeBSD

WezTerm is available [via the ports system](https://www.freshports.org/x11/wezterm/).

The most common FreeBSD architectures have pre-built binaries which you can install via:

```bash
$ pkg install wezterm
```

The version available in ports is not directly managed by the release
automation of the WezTerm project and may lag behind the latest release.  If
you need to run a newer version, then the [build from source](source.md)
instructions also apply to FreeBSD.
