## Installing on Linux via Flathub

WezTerm is available in flatpak format and published on
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.wezfurlong.wezterm), which is
aggregated into the GNOME Software application and other similar
storefront/software catalog applications.

To install using the command line:

First, [setup flatpak on your system](https://flatpak.org/setup/), then:

```console
$ flatpak install flathub org.wezfurlong.wezterm
```

and then run:

```console
$ flatpak run org.wezfurlong.wezterm
```

You may wish to define an alias for convenience:

```console
$ alias wezterm='flatpak run org.wezfurlong.wezterm'
```

!!! note
    flatpaks run in an isolated sandbox so some functionality may behave a little
    differently when compared to installing the native package format for your
    system.

    * starting wezterm using `wezterm cli` subcommands will block on the first
      run since you logged in if you haven't already launched the gui.
    * Process inspection functions such as determining the current directory
      for a pane will not work

    The flatpak is provided primarily for ease of trying out wezterm with
    low commitment, and you are encouraged to use native packages for your
    system once you're ready to get the most out of wezterm.

Only stable releases are allowed to be published to Flathub, so if
you want/need to try a nightly download you will need to use one of
the other options below.

## Installing on Linux using AppImage

WezTerm is available in [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) format; a
self-contained single file that doesn't require installation or
any special privileges to run, and that is compatible with a wide
range of Linux distributions.

Download and make the file executable and you're ready to run!

[AppImage :material-tray-arrow-down:]({{ ubuntu20_AppImage_stable }}){ .md-button }
[Nightly AppImage :material-tray-arrow-down:]({{ ubuntu20_AppImage_nightly }}){ .md-button }

```console
$ curl -LO {{ ubuntu20_AppImage_stable }}
$ chmod +x {{ ubuntu20_AppImage_stable_asset }}
```

You may then execute the appimage directly to launch wezterm, with no
specific installation steps required:

```console
$ ./{{ ubuntu20_AppImage_stable_asset }}
```

That said, you may wish to make it a bit more convenient:

```console
$ mkdir ~/bin
$ mv ./{{ ubuntu20_AppImage_stable_asset }} ~/bin/wezterm
$ ~/bin/wezterm
```

* Configuration instructions can be [found here](../config/files.md)

## Installing on Ubuntu and Debian-based Systems

The CI system builds `.deb` files for a variety of Ubuntu and Debian distributions.
These are often compatible with other Debian style systems; if you don't find one
that exactly matches your system you can try installing one from an older version
of your distribution, or use one of the Debian packages linked below.  Failing that,
you can try the AppImage download which should work on most Linux systems.

|Distro      | Stable           | Nightly             |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
|Ubuntu20    |[{{ ubuntu20_deb_stable_asset }}]({{ ubuntu20_deb_stable }})  |[{{ ubuntu20_deb_nightly_asset }}]({{ ubuntu20_deb_nightly }})|
|Ubuntu22    |[{{ ubuntu22_deb_stable_asset }}]({{ ubuntu22_deb_stable }}) |[{{ ubuntu22_deb_nightly_asset }}]({{ ubuntu22_deb_nightly }})|
|Debian10    |[{{ debian10_deb_stable_asset }}]({{ debian10_deb_stable }}) |[{{ debian10_deb_nightly_asset }}]({{ debian10_deb_nightly }})|
|Debian11    |[{{ debian11_deb_stable_asset }}]({{ debian11_deb_stable }}) |[{{ debian11_deb_nightly_asset }}]({{ debian11_deb_nightly }})|
|Debian12    |Nightly builds only|[{{ debian12_deb_nightly_asset }}]({{ debian12_deb_nightly }})|

To download and install from the CLI, you can use something like this, which
shows how to install the Ubuntu 20 package:

```console
$ curl -LO {{ ubuntu20_deb_stable }}
$ sudo apt install -y ./{{ ubuntu20_deb_stable_asset }}
```

* The package installs `/usr/bin/wezterm` and `/usr/share/applications/org.wezfurlong.wezterm.desktop`
* Configuration instructions can be [found here](../config/files.md)

## Installing on Fedora and rpm-based Systems

The CI system builds `.rpm` files on CentOS, Fedora and openSUSE systems.
These are likely compatible with other rpm-based distributions.
Alternatively, you can try the AppImage download with should work
on most Linux systems.

|Distro      | Stable           | Nightly             |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
|CentOS7     |[{{ centos7_rpm_stable_asset }}]({{ centos7_rpm_stable }}) |[{{ centos7_rpm_nightly_asset }}]({{ centos7_rpm_nightly }})|
|CentOS8     |[{{ centos8_rpm_stable_asset }}]({{ centos8_rpm_stable }}) |[{{ centos8_rpm_nightly_asset }}]({{ centos8_rpm_nightly }})|
|CentOS9     |[{{ centos9_rpm_stable_asset }}]({{ centos9_rpm_stable }})|[{{ centos9_rpm_nightly_asset }}]({{ centos9_rpm_nightly }})|
|Fedora36    |[{{ fedora36_rpm_stable_asset }}]({{ fedora36_rpm_stable }})|[{{ fedora36_rpm_nightly_asset }}]({{ fedora36_rpm_nightly }})|
|Fedora37    |[{{ fedora37_rpm_stable_asset }}]({{ fedora37_rpm_stable }})|[{{ fedora37_rpm_nightly_asset }}]({{ fedora37_rpm_nightly }})|
|Fedora38    |[{{ fedora38_rpm_stable_asset }}]({{ fedora38_rpm_stable }})|[{{ fedora38_rpm_nightly_asset }}]({{ fedora38_rpm_nightly }})|
|openSUSE Leap    |[{{ opensuse_leap_rpm_stable_asset }}]({{ opensuse_leap_rpm_stable }})|[{{ opensuse_leap_rpm_nightly_asset }}]({{ opensuse_leap_rpm_nightly }})|
|openSUSE Tumbleweed    |[{{ opensuse_tumbleweed_rpm_stable_asset }}]({{ opensuse_tumbleweed_rpm_stable }})|[{{ opensuse_tumbleweed_rpm_nightly_asset }}]({{ opensuse_tumbleweed_rpm_nightly }})|

To download and install from the CLI you can use something like this, which
shows how to install the Fedora 37 package:

```console
$ sudo dnf install -y {{ fedora37_rpm_stable }}
```

WezTerm is also available in the official Factory repo in openSUSE Tumbleweed. To install from Factory instead
from the rpm provided by WezTerm's Github repository, you can use Yast. If you prefer the CLI, you can install
it as root user with

```console
$ zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:Factory/standard/openSUSE:Factory.repo
$ zypper refresh
$ zypper install wezterm
```

* The package installs `/usr/bin/wezterm` and `/usr/share/applications/org.wezfurlong.wezterm.desktop`
* Configuration instructions can be [found here](../config/files.md)

## Arch Linux

WezTerm is available in the [Extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/wezterm/).

The version available in the extra repository may lag behind the latest wezterm release, so you may
wish to use one of these AUR options:

|What                 |Where|
|---------------------|-|
|Build from source    |<https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wezterm-git/>|

## Alpine Linux

APKs are no longer being built/supported by CI. You can still build it for yourself from source!

## Linuxbrew Tap

If you are a [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) user, you can install
wezterm from our tap:

```console
$ brew tap wez/wezterm-linuxbrew
$ brew install wezterm
```

If you'd like to use a nightly build you can perform a head install:

```console
$ brew install --HEAD wezterm
```

to upgrade to a newer nightly, it is simplest to remove then
install:

```console
$ brew rm wezterm
$ brew install --HEAD wezterm
```

## Raw Linux Binary

Another option for linux is a raw binary archive.  These are the same binaries that
are built for Ubuntu but provided in a tarball.

[Raw Linux Binary :material-tray-arrow-down:]({{ linux_raw_bin_stable }}){ .md-button }
[Nightly Raw Linux Binary :material-tray-arrow-down:]({{ linux_raw_bin_nightly }}){ .md-button }
