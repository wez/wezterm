## Changes

Releases are named using the date, time and git commit hash.

### Continuous/Nightly

A bleeding edge build is produced continually (as commits are made, and at
least a daily scheduled build) from the `main` branch.  It *may* not be usable
and the feature set may change, but since @wez uses this as a daily driver, its
usually the best available version.

As features stabilize some brief notes about them will accumulate here.

#### Changed
* Wayland: currently being reimplemented, it maybe more unstable than usual.
  Please file GH issues for any problems you see.
  Many thanks to @tzx and @tmccombs! #4777 #5781
* [show_update_window](config/lua/config/show_update_window.md) has been
  deprecated; it no longer has any effect and will be removed in a future
  release.
* X11: drag and drop is now supported for files, URLs and text. Thanks to
  @ssiegel! #5316 #640
* Added Unicode Symbols for Legacy Computing to the set of pixel-perfect block
  drawing glyphs. See
  [custom_block_glyphs](config/lua/config/custom_block_glyphs.md) for more
  details. Thanks to @stribor14! #5051 #5169
* Switched to the [nucleo](https://github.com/helix-editor/nucleo) fuzzy
  matcher which produces matches that more closely match the popular `fzf`
  program. #5532
* The Copy Mode `Close` action no longer implicitly scrolls to the bottom.
  This is to facilitate having a key assignment that closes copy mode without
  adjusting the viewport position. You can compose multiple actions together using
  `Multiple` if you wish; the default key assignments in Copy Mode use this technique
  so that the effective behavior of the defaults remains unchanged.
  Thanks to @LeszekSwirski! #4924 #3502
* Improved startup performance on X11. Thanks to @blukai! #5923 #5802
* There is now an upper bound of 999,999,999 for `scrollback_lines`. Thanks to
  @x3ro! #5996
* Migrated serial support to the `serial2` rust crate. This opens the door
  to more convenient serial support going forward. Thanks to @jeevithakannan2!
  #6411 #6460

#### New
* [wezterm.serde](config/lua/wezterm.serde/index.md) module for serialization
  and deserialization of JSON, TOML and YAML. Thanks to @expnn! #4969
* `wezterm ssh` now supports agent forwarding. Thanks to @Riatre! #5345
* SSH multiplexer domains now support agent forwarding, and will automatically
  maintain `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to an appropriate value on the destination host,
  depending on the value of the new
  [mux_enable_ssh_agent](config/lua/config/mux_enable_ssh_agent.md) option.
  ?988 #1647
* [default_ssh_auth_sock](config/lua/config/default_ssh_auth_sock.md) option
  to manage `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.
* Search mode: now supports richer line editing. Thanks to @Mrreadiness and
  @kenchou! #5416 #3087
* [show_close_tab_button_in_tabs](config/lua/config/show_close_tab_button_in_tabs.md)
  option for the fancy tab bar. Thanks to @zummenix! #3818
* wezterm-ssh now supports `ProxyUseFdPass`. Thanks to @loops! #6103 #6093
* `PromptInputLine` now supports a optional `prompt` and `initial_value`
  parameters. Thanks to @mgpinf and @ekorchmar! #6054 #6007

#### Fixed
* Race condition when very quickly adjusting font scale, and other improvements
  around resizing. Thanks to @jknockel! #4876 #5032 #5033
* macOS: wacky initial window size with external monitors or certain font
  sizes. #4966 #4250
* macOS: dragging non-filename data over wezterm could cause it to crash. #4771
* New tabs spawned by the gui could spawn into the wrong domain when using
  multiplexing together `default_domain`. Thanks to @bogdan2412! #4994
* Linux: the `divine_process_list` fallback function used the *vmwisze*
  rather than the intended *starttime* field to decide which process
  was the youngest. Thanks to @crides! #5001
* Wayland: fixed startup on Hyprland >= 0.37.0. Thanks to @fioncat! #5264 #5103
* Wayland: updated to SCTK 0.19. Thanks to @deviant and @tmccombs! #5276 #5154 #5079 #5071
  #4604 #5209 #5781
* Windows: Window buttons stopped working when using `win32_system_backdrop`.
  Thanks to @Kushagra2569! #5362 #5348
* `wezterm cli activate-pane` now respects `unzoom_on_switch_pane`. Thanks to
  @quantonganh! #5306 #5305
* wezterm-ssh now correctly handles two-phase processing of `%h` tokens. Thanks
  to @emc2314 and @wheatdog! #5163 #4503
* We now respect line wrapping in alt-screen mode. Thanks to @eternity74! #5396
  #3283
* Wayland: hang when launched under ChromeOS Crostini. Thanks to @dberlin!
  #5393 #5397
* macOS: Fixed notch avoidance padding in full screen mode. Thanks to @mbaird!
  #5515 #3807
* Render invalidation issue when closing tabs other than the last tab. Thanks
  to @Mrreadiness! #5441 #5304
* Search mode now accepts composed input from the IME. Thanks to @kenchou! #5564
* Quick select mode will now accept unix paths with `//` in them. #5763
* blob leases (for image rendering) could be removed by temporary directory
  cleaners, resulting in issues with rendering. We no longer store these
  in a pure temporary directory; they live in a cache dir, and if someone
  does remove or truncate these files, we now convert that error case
  into blank frame(s). #5422 #4657
* PaneInformation object returned `pixel_width` when asked to return the
  `pixel_height`.
* ssh: we now explicitly kill and reap the `ProxyCommand` associated
  with an ssh session. Thanks to @daaku! #5494 #5479
* `default_ssh_domains()` didn't use the default local echo threshold
  for ssh domains. #5547
* multiplexer: internal PKI certificate now supplements its list of
  "Subject Alternative Names" with the list of canonical hostnames returned
  for the local system via `getaddrinfo`. #5543
* DECSLRM incorrectly clamped the left margin based on the terminal height
  instead of the terminal width. Thanks to @j4james and @tmccombs! #5871 #5750
* Scrollback position was incorrectly advanced when in alt-screen mode.
  Thanks to @tbung and @loops! #6099 #4607 #6186
* Wayland: Fixed potential panic on startup when monitors have changed are
  in the process of hot plugging when wezterm starts. Thanks to @loops! #6084
* macOS: explicitly set the window to sRGB colorspace to resolve incorrect
  colors on non-sRGB monitors. Thanks to @rianmcguire! #6063 #5824
* The bell would ring each window instead of just the window containing the
  pane where the bell is ringing. Thanks to @loops! #6012 #5985
* x11: transient errors in obtaining/setting the selection could cause
  wezterm to exit. Thanks to @loops! #6135 #5482 #6128
* Wayland: potential panic when working with the clipboard. Thanks to @rengare!
  #5518
* multiplexer: could lose track of delta updates if the display changed
  while the current delta was being computed. Thanks to @loops! #5981
* Plugins: normalize the plugin path to exclude trailing slashes. Thanks to
  @joncrangle! #5883
* zooming a tab might not work if you also recently used `pane:activate()`.
  Thanks to @SpyMachine! #5964 #5928
* `pane:current_working_dir.file_path` returned incorrect results for
  paths that contained `#` or `?` characters. Thanks to @loops! #6158 #6171
* wayland: issues with losing maximized or tiled state when switching between
  applications. Thanks to @aliaksandr-trush! #4568 #5897

#### Updated
* Bundled conpty.dll and OpenConsole.exe to build 1.19.240130002.nupkg
* Bundled harfbuzz to 9.0.0
* image crate to 0.25, which means that JPEG images are now decoded via
  [zune-jpeg](https://docs.rs/zune-jpeg/latest/zune_jpeg/), which improves
  handling of non-conforming jpeg images. #5365

### 20240203-110809-5046fc22

#### Changed
* The default for
  [freetype_load_flags](config/lua/config/freetype_load_flags.md) is now
  `NO_HINTING` when the dpi is >= 100, otherwise `DEFAULT`. #4902
* `wezterm -e` will now wait for the spawned program to terminate before
  it will itself terminate. Thanks to @vimpostor! #4535 #4523
* Reverted the text cursor cell dimension change due to overwhelming and
  sometimes toxic feedback. #2882
#### New
* We now show the Lua version in the debug overlay. Thanks to @bbkane! #4943
* `wezterm start --new-tab` and `wezterm connect --new-tab` to request a new
  tab rather than a new window when spawning via an existing GUI instance.
  The new [prefer_to_spawn_tabs](config/lua/config/prefer_to_spawn_tabs.md)
  option allows you to make this happen by default. ?4854 ?4946
#### Fixed
* It was not possible to specify `freetype_load_flags = 'DEFAULT'`. #4902
* macOS: fallback fonts could select thin or otherwise unspecified font
  attributes. #4808
* Changing the palette via escape sequences didn't invalidate caches
  correctly, so those escapes sequences wouldn't take effect. #4932 #2635
* Unix: spawning a command using a relative path, with the cwd set to a
  directory that contains a directory with the same name as the relative
  path to the command would fail with an obscure error message. #4920
* x11: incorrect handling of the space key when `grp:win_space_toggle`
  was enabled via `setxkbmap`. #4910
* `wezterm set-working-directory` and `wezterm imgcat` didn't correctly
  apply tmux passthrough escape encoding. #4940
* Tab bar wouldn't immediately reflect the result of calling `tab:set_title`.
  #4941
* Command Palette: Missing space between keycaps on macOS. #4885
* macOS: stale/invalid cwd used when spawning new panes when shell integration
  is NOT in use. #4811
* Command Palette: would show default key assignments next to actions even
  if `disable_default_key_bindings` was configured. #4724

### 20240128-202157-1e552d76

#### Changed
* The default for [front_end](config/lua/config/front_end.md) is again
  `OpenGL`.
* The default for
  [freetype_load_flags](config/lua/config/freetype_load_flags.md) is now
  `NO_HINTING`. #4874

#### Fixed
* macOS: System LastResort font would be taken in preference to other fonts
  in some cases when trying to find the fallback for bold fonts. #4877
* The fancy tab bar could take a few moments to update after closing a tab. #4880
* Kitty Image Protocol: fixed numerous issues. Thanks to @jonboh! #1156 #1663
  #2084 #2422 #2761 #3918 #4233 #4847

### 20240127-113634-bbcac864

#### Changed
* The default for [front_end](config/lua/config/front_end.md) is now `WebGpu`.
* The return type of
  [pane.get_current_working_dir](config/lua/pane/get_current_working_dir.md)
  and [PaneInformation.current_working_dir](config/lua/PaneInformation.md)
  has changed to the new [Url](config/lua/wezterm.url/Url.md) object, which
  makes it easier to handle things like percent-encoding for paths with spaces
  or non-ASCII characters. Please see the revised example on
  [set_right_status](config/lua/window/set_right_status.md) for example usage
  with backwards compatibility in mind. #4000
* Added split out github short codes from the various charselect sections into
  their own new Short Codes section.
* CharSelect now shows emoji variations such as skin tones
* Improved fuzzy matching performance in CharSelect
* [PaneSelect](config/lua/keyassignment/PaneSelect.md) new modes `MoveToNewTab`,
  `MoveToNewWindow`, and `SwapWithActiveKeepFocus`, as well as
  `show_pane_ids=true` to show the pane ids.  #4147 #3014
* Nightly `.deb` packages are now named `wezterm-nightly` rather than `wezterm`,
  and are set to conflict with `wezterm`.
* Allow `window_frame` colors now allow specifying the alpha channel value,
  which enables transparent fancy tab bar backgrounds. ?4816 #3580 ?4311

#### New
* [wezterm imgcat](cli/imgcat.md) now has `--position`, `--no-move-cursor` and
  `--hold` options. #3716
* [wezterm set-working-directory](cli/set-working-directory.md) will now wrap
  its OSC 7 escape sequence in the tmux passthru sequence when necessary. This can be
  controlled via new `--tmux-passthru` option.
* [wezterm imgcat](cli/imgcat.md) will now wrap the image transfer OSC escape
  sequences in the tmux passthru sequence when necessary. This can be
  controlled via new `--tmux-passthru` option. Note that tmux doesn't natively
  understand these sequences, and tmux will wipe out the image when it redraws
  the screen as part of scrolling back through its history. imgcat support in
  tmux is very basic effort
* [wezterm imgcat](cli/imgcat.md) will compensate for tmux and conpty, which
  do not natively understand image protocols, and adjust the cursor position
  in order to avoid the shell/prompt from mangling the image after it is printing.
  Support for this has limitations and will not take effect when the new
  `--position` argument is used. #3624
* [wezterm imgcat](cli/imgcat.md) will now resample very large images in
  order to increase the chances of successfully displaying an arbitrary image.
  In addition, there are now a number of options for explicitly resizing
  as a preprocessing step, and controlling the filtering and format used
  by the resizing, along with showing diagnostics around the resize operation. #3264
* Color schemes: [Aardvark Blue](colorschemes/a/index.md#aardvark-blue),
  [alacritty](colorschemes/a/index.md),
  [Apple System Colors](colorschemes/a/index.md#apple-system-colors),

* Preliminary support for rasterizing fonts with COLR v1 glyphs, such as
  more recent versions of Noto Color Emoji. #4148
* [wezterm cli zoom-pane](cli/cli/zoom-pane.md). Thanks to @quantonganh! #4160
* [InputSelector](config/lua/keyassignment/InputSelector.md) has been
  enhanced to allow setting an alphabet for quickly launching items beyond

  [ToggleAlwaysOnBottom](config/lua/keyassignment/ToggleAlwaysOnBottom.md) and
  [SetWindowLevel](config/lua/keyassignment/SetWindowLevel.md) key assignments
  for manipulating the window level. These are currently implemented only
  on macOS. Thanks to @rawnly! #4567
* Double click on the tab bar to toggle maximize/normal state. Thanks to
  @junnplus! #3698 #3699
* [freetype_load_target](config/lua/config/freetype_load_target.md) and
  [freetype_render_target](config/lua/config/freetype_render_target.md) can now
  be set to `VerticalLcd` for vertically decimated LCD displays. Thanks to
  @xiaopengli89! #4426
* Pressing `CTRL-[` in the launcher menu will close it. #4722
* [pane:get_lines_as_escapes()](config/lua/pane/get_lines_as_escapes.md) to
  retrieve text + style/formatting. #4780

#### Fixed
* Command Palette was using now-invalid Nerd Font 2.0 symbols for macOS
  keyboard shortcuts. #3988
* Windows: couldn't use shifted keys like `(` in the Debug Overlay. #3999
* X11: fd leak on each call to
  [wezterm.gui.enumerate_gpus](config/lua/wezterm.gui/enumerate_gpus.md). #3612
* Charselect and repl recency/history were not persisted across restarts. #4047 ?4019
* macOS: system font fallback didn't always find a workable fallback font. #4099 #849
* F13-F24 keys are now supported. Thanks to @ovidiu-ionescu! #3937
* Strikethrough position was not centered when setting `line_height` #4196
* Text cursor filled the scaled-by `line_height` and `cell_width` dimensions rather
  than the native font dimensions and looked weird when either config option was
  not set to `1.0`. #2882
* Using `CloseCurrentPane` could sometimes leave a stranded pane in a tab. #4030
* Wayland: wezterm wouldn't start on Plasma 6 or newer versions of sway. Thanks
  to @hexchain! #3996 #4322.
* font-config: when resolving a fallback font for a text cluster like `U+3065,U+2686`
  where no single font contains both glyphs, wezterm would fail to show a glyph
  for either codepoint.  We now split the fallback query up and query for each
  individual codepoint separately. #4310
* Gogh color schemes all had the incorrect cursor foreground color. #4257
* Windows: crash on Windows 11 when using DX 12 with the WebGpu frontend. #4279
* macOS: Leak of NSWindow and NSView objects. Thanks to @0f-0b! #4457
* Initial G1 state is non-conformant. Thanks to @ninjalj! #4534 #3962
* Make RIS also clear the alternate screen. Thanks to @ninjalj! #4563
* DECRQCRA: treat uninitialized cells as spaces. Thanks to @ninjalj! #4565
* Clamp cursor position reported by CPR. Thanks to @ninjalj! #4564
* Correct `SUPER` modifier key handling in kitty protocol. Thanks to @gabyx! #4605
* macOS: honor the `window_close_confirmation` config option when quitting the
  application. Thanks to @quantonganh! #4420 #4362
* terminfo: added missing terminator to Sync capability. Thanks to @gpanders! #4578
* bracketed paste escape sequences are now always stripped out of text
  that is pasted into the terminal. This happens even if bracketed paste
  mode is disabled. #4765
* Sixel parser ignores P2 parameter if P1 is blank. Thanks to @joouha! #4730
* X11: synthesize raw modifiers to resolve some issues with synthetic/injected
  key press events experienced by Espanso. Thanks to @bew! #4151 #3840
* `freetype_load_target` had no effect. Thanks to @dkoukola! #4775 #4770
* Incorrect sunset / sunrise progression. Thanks to @mikyk10! #4809 #4810
* retro tab bar indented too far on macOS when using integrated titlebar buttons.
  Thanks to @0xdead10cd! #4505
* x11/wayland: avoid including keysym name in deadkey compose cursor. #4511
* Mouse wheel scrolling now works correctly when hovering over the inactive pane.
  Thanks to @tradiff! #4339 #2373
* Scrolling glitch in Command Palette, Launcher and InputSelector. Thanks to
  @metiftikci! #4839
* Pane resizing, especially around zooming, could sometimes leave artifacts due
  to a cache invalidation issue. #4828

  or high speed keyboard inputs. #4615 #3840
* X11: can now paste STRING (latin-1) data from the clipboard, in addition to
  UTF-8 string data. #4402
* [use_resize_increments](config/lua/config/use_resize_increments.md) now
  accounts for window padding. Thanks to @jknockel! #4824
* Bar shaped text cursors are now rendered above text. Thanks to
  @ErrorNoInternet! #4850
* `format-tab-title` event was triggered excessively for background tabs/panes.
  Thanks to @crides for investigating! #4788

#### Updated
* Bundled harfbuzz to 8.3.0
* Bundled freetype to 2.13.1
* Bundled Noto Color Emoji font to 2.038
* Bundled Nerd Font Symbols font to v3.1.1.
* wgpu to 0.18, which [improves OpenGL compatibility with older GPUs when using
  WebGpu with its GL backend on Windows](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/releases/tag/v0.18.0)

### 20230712-072601-f4abf8fd

#### Changed

* The default for
  [adjust_window_size_when_changing_font_size](config/lua/config/adjust_window_size_when_changing_font_size.md)
  now depends on the window environment and the contents of
  [tiling_desktop_environments](config/lua/config/tiling_desktop_environments.md).
* Added eigth block corner glyphs to custom block glyphs. Thanks to @joouha! #3559
* Don't hide mouse cursor when pressing only modifier keys. #3570
* [PaneSelect](config/lua/keyassignment/PaneSelect.md) will now un-zoom to show
  all panes, then re-zoom after performing its action. #3573
* Images, especially animated images, are now decoded in the background. When
  used as a background layer for the terminal, we now use the normal
  terminal background color as a placeholder until the first frame has been
  decoded. In other circumstances, you may observe a brief black frame while
  waiting for the image to decode.
* You may now use CTRL-J/K to change the selection in the launcher menu,
  in addition to CTRL-N/P which always worked previously. #3909
* Duplicate entries in [CharSelect](config/lua/keyassignment/CharSelect.md) are
  now suppressed, making it less cluttered. Thanks to @vimpostor! #3674

#### New

* [window:keyboard_modifiers](config/lua/window/keyboard_modifiers.md) #3444
* [win32_system_backdrop](config/lua/config/win32_system_backdrop.md). Thanks to @kingavatar! #3528 #1614
* [wezterm cli adjust-pane-size](cli/cli/adjust-pane-size.md). Thanks to @mrjones2014! #3471 #3491
* [augment-command-palette](config/lua/window-events/augment-command-palette.md)
  event for adding entries to the command palette without assigning keyboard
  shortcuts. #3595
* [char_select_bg_color](config/lua/config/char_select_bg_color.md) and
  [char_select_fg_color](config/lua/config/char_select_fg_color.md) options to
  customize the appearance of
  [CharSelect](config/lua/keyassignment/CharSelect.md) mode. Thanks to @junnplus! #3703
* Horizontal mouse wheel events are now passed through to the terminal. Thanks to @calops! #3856
* [exit_behavior_messaging](config/lua/config/exit_behavior_messaging.md)
  option to control output when holding a pane open after a process completes.
  #3423
* [default_mux_server_domain](config/lua/config/default_mux_server_domain.md) for the
  (almost!) equivalent to [default_domain](config/lua/config/default_domain.md) in
  the context of the mux server.

#### Fixed

* Modals, such as `CharSelect` and `CommandPalette` did not respect alternative
  OS-level key maps. #3470
* X11/Wayland: CTRL-key presses for non-US latin keymaps regressed due to
  changes to [improve handling of CTRL-key presses for non-latin
  layouts](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2845). #3610
* Numerous issues with the kitty keyboard protocol implementation #2546 #3220
  #3315 #3473 #3474 #3476 #3478 #3479 #3484 #3526
* mux: Attempting to spawn into an ad-hoc SSH domain after the last tab could
  fail with a cryptic error message. The connection is now re-established. ?3480
* Laggy behavior when processing a continual stream of output, for example,
  serial data received at a rate of 1 byte just slightly faster than
  `mux_output_parser_coalesce_delay_ms` (`3ms` by default). Thanks to @pcc!
  #3497 #3466 #837.
* [`user-var-changed` event](config/lua/window-events/user-var-changed.md)
  would incorrectly trigger for every GUI window, rather than just the GUI
  window which contained the pane in which the variable was changed. #3524
* PNG images without an alpha channel, or that were grayscale, could not be displayed by in the
  terminal. #3529 #3742
* tab width calculation when returning a string with embedded escape
  sequences from a `format-tab-title` event handler. #3481
* Windows: clicking the maximize button didn't work unless using
  integrated titlebar buttons. #3499
* Windows: closing a window while the debug overlay was active could
  leave a lingering wezterm-gui.exe running. #3522
* Windows: inconsistencies with win32 input mode. Thanks to @kreudom! #2235
* macOS: font size is zoomed or window appears empty when first launched on a
  secondary monitor with different scaling settings from the primary monitor. #3503
* X11/Wayland: CTRL/ALT didn't work as expected for non-latin keyboard layouts. #2845
* X11: panic after a lot of horizontal touchpad scrolling. #3564
* Wayland: mouse cursor wouldn't reappear after keyboard input hides it. #3334
* WebGPU: `window_background_opacity` was not always enabled when using a
  vulkan backend. #3589
* macOS: hang or crash when trying to copy or right click the about dialog.
  The about dialog has been replaced with a menu item that you can click to
  copy the version number. #3507 #3585
* Synthesized italics were double-skewed. Thanks to @rozbb! #3613 #3555
* Panic when using corrupt/invalid webp images as window background #3614
* imgcat broken when using `wezterm ssh`. #3624
* macOS: pasting file(s) will now paste the quoted full path(s) rather than
  just the basename of the path. Thanks to @junnplus! #3663 #3665
* WebGpu: don't panic when trying to allocate a texture larger than is
  supported by the GPU. #3713
* `CopyMode("EditPattern")` didn't switch the key table to `search_mode` #3746.
* Windows: access denied error when using `wezterm.plugin.require`. Thanks to @nyxkrage! #3767
* Windows: when shell integration was used, the last line of output could get
  overwritten due to a conpty issue. #3531
* Changing the color palette back to the default without resetting the terminal
  would prevent changes to `color_scheme` from taking effect. #3685
* ClearToEndOfLine performed in the last column of the display, when it is
  prepped to wrap to the next line, would incorrectly clear the last cell.
  #3548
* WEZTERM_UNIX_SOCKET didn't get set when using `wezterm start -- something`. #3679
* Pasting large amounts of text in helix caused issues. #3683
* Wayland: Copying to clipboard was not always successful when triggered by the
  keyboard. Thanks to @osandov! #3929
* `wezterm ssh` connection errors were not shown; the window would close
  immediately with the default `exit_behavior` setting. Now ssh sessions
  override `exit_behavior="CloseOnCleanExit"` while connecting so that error
  information can be displayed. #3941
* Divide by zero panic with lots of splits and resizing panes. #3921
* Spawn failures were not shown; the window would close immediately
  with the default `exit_behavior` setting. Now local commands override
  `exit_behavior="CloseOnCleanExit"` if the command fails to spawn, and
  a more detailed error message is shown explaining what failed. #3928 #3950
* macOS: middle mouse button dragging. Thanks to @JacobMalloy! #3908
* Attempting to spawn a non-local domain via the mux server would fail with
  invalid domain because none of the additional domains from your config were
  registered with the mux server. #3907

#### Updated
* Bundled harfbuzz to 8.0.1
* Bundled freetype to 2.13.0
* Bundled Nerd Font Symbols font to v3.0.1. Note that there are several
  [breaking changes in v3](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

### 20230408-112425-69ae8472

#### Changed
* macOS: Japanese IME users: CTRL-modified keys are no long routed to the IME
  by default, as it introduced problems with CTRL-key combinations for other users.
  A new [macos_forward_to_ime_modifier_mask](config/lua/config/macos_forward_to_ime_modifier_mask.md)
  option has been introduced to allow you to control which modifier keys get routed
  to the IME, so that you can opt back in to that behavior. #2630 #2771 #2435
* Multiplexer client can now send the locally configured color palette to the
  mux server, which makes it more straightforward to configure color schemes
  when using multiplexing.
* Multiplexer: closing a window that has any mux client panes will now detach
  the associated domain(s) on close. Previous behavior was to treat just the
  panes in the window as detached without actually detaching the whole domain,
  which would cause the window to recycle and activate a different workspace.
  With a definitive detach, the window will close and wezterm will terminate if
  the only panes were associated with that domain, which is what most users
  expect. #2644
* [quick_select_patterns](config/lua/config/quick_select_patterns.md) and
  [hyperlink_rules](config/lua/config/hyperlink_rules.md) now support
  backreferences and look around assertions. #3247
* [wezterm replay](cli/replay.md) new options `--explain-only`, `--cat`. #3446

#### New
* [PromptInputLine](config/lua/keyassignment/PromptInputLine.md) action for
  prompting the user for a line of text and then doing something with it.
  Can be used to prompt for (re)naming new or existing tabs, workspaces and so on.
* [InputSelector](config/lua/keyassignment/InputSelector.md) action for
  prompting the user to select an item from a list and then doing something
  with it.
* [pane:activate()](config/lua/pane/activate.md) and [tab:activate()](config/lua/MuxTab/activate.md). #3217
* [ulimit_nofile](config/lua/config/ulimit_nofile.md) and [ulimint_nproc](config/lua/config/ulimit_nproc.md) options. ?3353
* [serial_ports](config/lua/config/serial_ports.md) for more convenient access to serial ports
* `ssh_domains` now auto-populate from your `~/.ssh/config` file. You can use
  [wezterm.default_ssh_domains()](config/lua/wezterm/default_ssh_domains.md) to
  obtain that same information and amend/extend it.
* [display_pixel_geometry](config/lua/config/display_pixel_geometry.md) to specify subpixel antialiasing geometry. ?3422
* Integrated title and tab bar.
  See also [window_decorations](config/lua/config/window_decorations.md),
  [integrated_title_button_style](config/lua/config/integrated_title_button_style.md),
  [integrated_title_buttons](config/lua/config/integrated_title_buttons.md),
  [integrated_title_button_alignment](config/lua/config/integrated_title_button_alignment.md)
  [integrated_title_button_color](config/lua/config/integrated_title_button_color.md) and,
  if you are using the retro tab bar, [tab_bar_style](config/lua/config/tab_bar_style.md).
  Thanks to @yuraiz for getting things moving! #2722 #1180
* Lua: [gui_window:active_tab()](config/lua/window/active_tab.md),
  [gui_window:active_pane()](config/lua/window/active_pane.md) (surprise! this was already there, just undocumented!),
  [mux_window:active_tab()](config/lua/mux-window/active_tab.md),
  [mux_window:active_pane()](config/lua/mux-window/active_pane.md),
  [tab:active_pane()](config/lua/MuxTab/active_pane.md) methods for conveniently getting at the active tab/pane
  from a window/tab.
* [wezterm cli set-tab-title](cli/cli/set-tab-title.md) and

#### Fixed
* mux: Stale remote window mapping could prevent spawning new tabs in remote domain. #2759
* mux: Splitting then killing a pane could result in incorrect pane sizes. #3386
* Windows: "error converting Lua string to &str" on systems with an ACP that
  was not compatible with UTF-8 when wezterm was placed in a directory with
  a non UTF-8, non-ASCII name. #3390
* mux: `--config` related command line options passed to `wezterm-mux-server` were
  not propagated when using `--daemonize`. #3397 #2686
* mux: server would lock and then unlock the pid/lock file when it re-executed,
  rendering it useless.
* `tab:panes_with_info()` reported incorrect `is_zoomed` value. #3404
* [window:perform_action()](config/lua/window/perform_action.md) now awaits the
  dispatch of the key assignment action, making it less racy to script multiple
  actions in a row. Note that clipboard operations are still asynchronous with
  respect to the dispatch of the assignment. #3405
* [window:perform_action()](config/lua/window/perform_action.md) now correctly
  resolves overlay panes such as Copy Mode. #3209
* macOS: CTRL-Q had to be pressed twice to register when `use_ime=true`. #2630
* mux: [tab:set_title()](config/lua/MuxTab/set_title.md) didn't get passed to
  the remote server, so any tab title changes were lost when reconnecting. #1598
* `wezterm connect --workspace WS DOM` didn't use the provided workspace when
  starting up the mux server. #2734
* mux: `ClearScrollback` was not forwarded to remote server. #2624
* ssh: `%r` `%h` and `%p` tokens were implicitly supported by libssh but stopped
  working in `ProxyCommand` when we took over running the proxy command. #3437
* mux: Improved latency for large window sizes. #1872
* mux: [pane:has_unseen_output()](config/lua/pane/has_unseen_output.md) and
  [PaneInformation.has_unseen_output](config/lua/PaneInformation.md) now work
  with multiplexer panes. #2625
* mux: attempting to split a remote pane into a different target domain could
  produce a warning about the remote home directory not being readable to
  the local machine or vice versa. #3442
* `wezterm.config_builder` now works with `table.insert(config.keys, {..})`
* mux: `wezterm cli activate-pane-direction` inconsistent behavior with remote mux. #3387 #3448
* [quick_select_patterns](config/lua/config/quick_select_patterns.md) didn't
  take precedence over built-in rules. #3456
* Painted pane background color behind the tab bar when there was only one
  pane. Matters when the tab bar is transparent! #3450
* Wayland: window not repainting consistently when using the keyboard when
  using `front_end="WebGpu"`.  Thanks to @jokeyrhyme for working through
  different iterations of this fix! #3126
* Windows: reloading the config could partially knock the window out of
  full screen mode. #3439

### 20230326-111934-3666303c

#### New
* [mouse_wheel_scrolls_tabs](config/lua/config/mouse_wheel_scrolls_tabs.md) option
  to control whether the mouse wheel can be used to activate tabs when hovering
  over the tab bar. Thanks to @eaglgenes101! #3227
* [wezterm cli kill-pane](cli/cli/kill-pane.md),
  [wezterm cli activate-pane](cli/cli/activate-pane.md) and
  [wezterm cli activate-tab](cli/cli/activate-tab.md) #3352 #886
* macOS:
  [macos_window_background_blur](config/lua/config/macos_window_background_blur.md)
  enables a nice translucent window effect. Thanks to @Gkirito! #3344
* [new-tab-button-click event](config/lua/window-events/new-tab-button-click.md)
  allows overriding the effect of clicking the New Tab button. #323
* [pane:move_to_new_window()](config/lua/pane/move_to_new_window.md),
  [pane:move_to_new_tab()](config/lua/pane/move_to_new_tab.md). #3374

#### Fixed
* ssh ProxyCommand didn't parse command lines containing `=` correctly. #3307
* `wezterm.GLOBALS.foo` now supports `__len` and `__pairs` metamethods, as well
  as being passed to `wezterm.json_encode`
* `wezterm --skip-config` resulted in an `unexpected argument` error, while
  `wezterm -n` still worked as intended. #3325
* Using `RESIZE|MACOS_FORCE_DISABLE_SHADOW` or
  `RESIZE|MACOS_FORCE_ENABLE_SHADOW` would cause a spooky titlebar to appear.
  Thanks to @noefroidevaux! #3330
* ConPTY: logical line wrapping falsely joining long runs of output from classic
  windows console subsystem programs. The behavior now is to only mark long lines
  as wrapped if the last character on the prior line is alphanumeric or ascii
  punctuation. Other characters will cause the logical line to break.
  #3278 #3177
* `wezterm cli activate-pane-direction` didn't cause the gui to repaint, making
  it difficult to notice that the active pane had changed. Thanks to @ir-ae!
  #3303 #2879 #3323
* `window_frame.border_XXX` not correctly accounted for when initially sizing
  the window, or when applying font scaling to a window. #3333
* `RIS` escape sequence (and `ResetTerminal` action) didn't disable mouse
  event reporting.
* Unblock all signals when spawning programs, to avoid strangess when the
  parent of the wezterm process spawns wezterm with an unusual signal mask.
* Lingering openconsole.exe processes on Windows. Thanks to @mbikovitsky! #3339
* macos: command line parameters beyond the first were treated as terminal
  command scripts and opened spurious windows. #3340
* imgcat broken with multiplexer protocol #3343
* `wezterm cli activate-pane-direction` would not cause the focus to change
  in the GUI when explicitly using multiplexing domains. #2863
* macOS: update entitlements so that macOS will prompt the user when they
  spawn an app that wants to use the microphone and other resources. #3359
* Command palette didn't show command label or arguments for entries constructed
  from your key assignments, making it difficult to distinguish them from each other. #3252
* macOS: key assignments that were routed via the macOS menubar didn't guarantee
  to invalidate the associated window, making it look like they had no effect
  or hung. #3365
* `CTRL-SHIFT-R` assignment in `CharSelect` mode didn't cycle back through
  the emoji categories as intended, but performed the global `ReloadConfiguration`
  action instead. #2947
* mux: resizing the window larger, then spawning a tab, would result in the new
  tab having pixel dimensions of 0 and prevent imgcat from functioning until the
  tab was explicitly resized. #3366
* mux: initial attach and spawn would leave the dpi at the assumed dpi resulting
  in incorrect image scaling for imgcat. #3366
* mux: `wezterm cli move-pane-to-new-tab` didn't resync new window structure
  and would appear to have had no effect until you detached and re-attached. #3219
* mux: `wezterm cli move-pane-to-new-tab` didn't forward the structural change
  to a remote mux, so if you ran it against the mux in your GUI, the state on
  the actual mux server was not updated. #3374

#### Updated
* Bundled JetBrainsMono to 2.304. #3362

### 20230320-124340-559cb7b0

#### New
* Copy Mode now supports using `CTRL-u` and `CTRL-d` to move by half a page at
  a time. Thanks to [@pengux](https://github.com/pengux)!
  [#2662](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2662)
* macOS: allow association with `.command`, `.sh`, `.zsh`, `.bash`, `.fish` and
  `.tool` scripts, so that those can open and show their output in the
  terminal. [#2871](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2871)
  [#2741](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2741)
* macOS: initial cut at macOS native menu bar
  [#1485](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1485)

  thanks to [@GZLiew](https://github.com/GZLiew)!
  [#2908](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2908)
* [tab:get_size()](config/lua/MuxTab/get_size.md),
  [tab:rotate_counter_clockwise()](config/lua/MuxTab/rotate_counter_clockwise.md).
  [tab:rotate_counter_clockwise()](config/lua/MuxTab/rotate_counter_clockwise.md).
* [wezterm.config_builder()](config/lua/wezterm/config_builder.md)
* [gui-attached](config/lua/gui-events/gui-attached.md) event provides some
  more flexibility at startup.
* [wezterm cli get-text](cli/cli/get-text.md) command for capturing the content of a pane.
* macOS: added a dock menu that allows spawning new windows. Thanks to
  [@dahlia](https://github.com/dahlia)!
  [#3054](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/3054)
* [quit_when_all_windows_are_closed](config/lua/config/quit_when_all_windows_are_closed.md)
  configuration option.
* `CTRL-SHIFT-P` now activates the new [command
  palette](config/lua/keyassignment/ActivateCommandPalette.md)
  [#1485](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1485)
* `wezterm ssh` now supports `%l` and `%L` tokens in config files.
  [#3176](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3176)
* [hyperlink_rules](config/lua/config/hyperlink_rules.md) now support
  specifying which capture group should be highlighted.
* [wezterm.default_hyperlink_rules](config/lua/wezterm/default_hyperlink_rules.md)
  function makes it easier to extend the default set of hyperlink rules.

#### Fixed
* X11: hanging or killing the IME could hang wezterm
  [#2819](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2819)
* `wezterm ssh` now respects the `AddressFamily` option when connecting
  [#2893](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2893)
* Windows: panic when minimizing a window when `front_end='WebGpu'`
  [#2881](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2881)
* X11: `wezterm.screens().active` is now populated based on the currently
  focused window, rather than just copying the `main` screen data. Thanks to
  [@NBonaparte](https://github.com/NBonaparte)!
  [#2928](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2928)
* Resizing windows when overriding the dpi in the config would not respect
  the specified dpi. Thanks to [@niclashoyer](https://github.com/niclashoyer)!
  [#2914](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2914)
  [#2978](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2978)
* Wayland: mouse cursor didn't auto-hide when typing. Thanks to
  [@jmbaur](https://github.com/jmbaur)!
  [#2977](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2977)
* mux: `default_workspace` was not always respected when spawning
  [#2981](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2981)
* [window:active_key_table()](config/lua/window/active_key_table.md) now
  factors in pane-specific key table stacks for things like `CopyMode`.
  [#2986](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/discussions/2986)
* modal overlays like CharSelect and the [command
  palette](config/lua/keyassignment/ActivateCommandPalette.md) sometimes
  wouldn't render when first activated until pressing a key.
* lag when making heavy use of foreground process information in tab titles.
  [#2991](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2991)
* X11: always update selection owner even if our window already owns it
  [#2926](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2926)
* command output would not be displayed if the command exited almost
  immediately after starting up.
* Windows: ALT key was not recognized when processing mouse events.
  Thanks to [@mbikovitsky](https://github.com/mbikovitsky)!
  [#3053](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/3053)
* Copy Mode:
  [MoveForwardWord](config/lua/keyassignment/CopyMode/MoveForwardWord.md) not
  always moving to next line.  thanks to [@GZLiew](https://github.com/GZLiew)!
  [#2955](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2955)
* Wayland: fixup hidpi scaling when `front_end="WebGpu"`. Thanks to
  [@valpackett](https://github.com/valpackett)!
  [#2877](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2887)
* Reloading the config while a pane was zoomed could result in visual artifacts
  [#3068](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3068)
* SSH: Closing an individual pane via `CloseCurrentPane` would kill the remote
  pane but not detect that it had exited.
  [#3095](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3095)
* Panic when decoding animated webp images
  [#3250](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3250)
* Config was not applied to non-zoomed panes when config was reloaded
  [#3259](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3259)
* Default [hyperlink_rules](config/lua/config/hyperlink_rules.md) now match
  URLs with port numbers
  [#928](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/928)
* Incorrect cursor position after processing iTerm2 image escape sequence
  [#3266](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3266)
* Images are now buffered to temporary files and decoded in background
  threads. This reduces the RAM overhead especially of long animations and
  reduces the render latency due to decoding frames; animations now render as
  soon as the first frame is decoded.
  [#3263](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3263)
* Improved compatibility with the Kitty Image Protocol
  [#2716](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2716)
* [wezterm.time.call_after](config/lua/wezterm.time/call_after.md) would not
  work when used in an event callback.
  [#3026](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3026)
* Hover state not correctly indicated for retro tab bar when showing at
  the bottom of the window
  [#3113](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3113)

#### Changed
* `CTRL-SHIFT-P` now activates the new [command
  palette](config/lua/keyassignment/ActivateCommandPalette.md), instead of
  `PaneSelect` [#1485](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1485)
* Window title reporting escape sequences are now disabled by default.
  [See here for more details](https://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=104612710031920&w=2)
* Withdraw DEC private SGR escapes that affect superscript and
  subscript due to xterm/vim conflict
  [mintty/#1189](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/1189)
* Removed deprecated `Copy`, `Paste` and `PastePrimarySelection` actions. Use
  [CopyTo](config/lua/keyassignment/CopyTo.md) and
  [PasteFrom](config/lua/keyassignment/PasteFrom.md) instead.
* `wezterm -e` is now an alias for `wezterm start`. Thanks to
  [@Abdiramen](https://github.com/Abdiramen)!
  [#2889](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2889)
  [#2782](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2782)
* [bold_brightens_ansi_colors](config/lua/config/bold_brightens_ansi_colors.md)
  now supports `"BrightOnly"` to use the bright color without selecting a bold
  font. [#2932](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2932)
* Color schemes: `Gruvbox Dark` was renamed to `GruvboxDark` and adjusted in
  the upstream iTerm2-Color-Schemes repo
* Config warnings, such as using deprecated or invalid fields will now cause
  the configuration error window to be shown. Previously, only hard errors were
  shown, which meant that a number of minor config issues could be overlooked.
* Referencing `wezterm.GLOBAL` now returns references rather than copies, making
  it less cumbersome to code read/modify/write with global state
* `wezterm start` now accepts `--domain` and `--attach` options. `wezterm
  connect DOMAIN` is now implemented internally as `wezterm start --domain
  DOMAIN --attach`.
* X11: spurious pointer focus events no longer influence terminal focus events.
  Thanks to [@NBonaparte](https://github.com/NBonaparte)!
  [#2959](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2959)
* Copy Mode: Added <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> default assignments.
  Thanks to [@cunha](https://github.com/cunha)!
  [#2762](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2762)
* [wezterm.mux.spawn_window](config/lua/wezterm.mux/spawn_window.md) and
  [SpawnCommandInNewWindow](config/lua/keyassignment/SpawnCommandInNewWindow.md)
  now accept a position field to control initial gui window position.
  [#2976](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2976)
* X11/Wayland: Mouse based selection once again copies to both the clipboard
  and the primary selection. This was the original intended behavior but a
  regression in an earlier release changed it by accident and it's been
  annoying me ever since. You are welcome to define your own [mouse
  bindings](config/mouse.md) if you want to change that behavior.
* WSL Domains returned from
  [wezterm.default_wsl_domains](config/lua/wezterm/default_wsl_domains.md) now
  set `default_cwd="~"` [#2826](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2826)
* wezterm now also searches `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` as well as `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
  when searching for config files. Thanks to [@jmbaur](https://github.com/jmbaur)!
  [#3146](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/3146)
* [wezterm.time.call_after](config/lua/wezterm.time/call_after.md) now accepts
  fractional numbers of seconds.
  [#3287](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3287)

  [#2492](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2492)
  [#2452](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2452)
* If the underline attribute was active and CRLF scrolled a new line into the
  bottom of the display, we'd fill that new line with underlines.
  [#2489](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2489)

  [#2435](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2435)
* multiplexer: The lag indicator that gets overlaid on the pane content
  when waiting a long time for a response now defaults to disabled.  It is

  bar](config/lua/pane/get_metadata.md), but you may re-enable the old way
  using `overlay_lag_indicator = true` in the appropriate domain
  configuration.

  matching non-monospace fonts if we can't find any matching monospace fonts.
  [#2468](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/discussions/2468)
* `os.getenv` now knows how to resolve environment variables that would normally
  require logging out to update, such as `SHELL` (if you `chsh` on unix systeams),
  or those set through the registry on Windows. [#2481](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/discussions/2481)
* Searching is now incremental and shows progress. [#1209](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1209)

Fuzzy search by name or hex unicode codepoint value, or browse with keys. `CTRL-r` to cycle the browser between categories. `Enter` to select an item, copy it to the clipboard and send it to the active pane as input. `Esc` to cancel. [CharSelect](config/lua/keyassignment/CharSelect.md).
* `CTRL-SHIFT-P` is now a default assignment for [PaneSelect](config/lua/keyassignment/PaneSelect.md)

#### Changed

* `colors` now override colors from your selected `color_scheme`. Previously, `color_scheme` was mutually exclusive with `colors` and always took precedence. The new behavior is more in line with what most people expect.
* Reduced CPU utilization for busy/large screen updates, blinking cursor and other easing animations
* [ActivatePaneDirection](config/lua/keyassignment/ActivatePaneDirection.md) now uses recency to resolve ambiguous moves [#2374](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2374)
* [update-status](config/lua/window-events/update-status.md) is a more general event for updating left or right status. `update-right-status` is considered to be deprecated in favor of `update-status`.
* Cache XDG Portal Appearance values. Thanks to [@vimposter](https://github.com/vimpostor)! [#2402](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2402)
* Compensate for TUI programs that flicker due to unsynchronized output by adding up to 3ms additional latency after each read to coalesce their screen outputs into a single frame. You can set this delay via a new `mux_output_parser_coalesce_delay_ms` option. [#2443](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2443)
* win32: Updated openconsole/conpty to v1.14.2281.0

* ssh: correctly expand `%h` ssh_config tokens [#2448](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2448)
* ssh: `CloseCurrentPane` wouldn't release all resources associated with the pane and could lead to a `too many open files` error for a long running `wezterm ssh` session. [#2466](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2466)
* mouse cursor is now reset to arrow when the mouse leaves the window [#2471](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2471)

* [pane:is_alt_screen_active()](config/lua/pane/is_alt_screen_active.md) for testing whether the alt screen is active. Thanks to [@Funami580](https://github.com/Funami580)! [#2234](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2234)
* X11/Wayland: [XDG desktop portal](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/) is now used to determine whether dark mode is in use [#2258](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2258)

  [#2273](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2273)
  [#2253](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2253)
* Internal scrollback datastructure improvements reduce per-cell overhead by up to ~40x depending on the composition of the line (lines with lots of varied attributes or image attachments will have more overhead).
* Improved search performance
* Quickselect: now defaults to searching 1000 lines above and below the current viewport, making it faster and the labels shorter for users with a larger scrollback. A new `scope_lines` parameter to [QuickSelectArgs](config/lua/keyassignment/QuickSelectArgs.md) allows controlling the search region explicitly. Thanks to [@yyogo](https://github.com/yyogo) for the initial PR! [#1317](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1317)
* OSC 10, 11 and 12 (Set Default Text Background, Default Text Foreground Color, and Text Cursor Color) now support setting the alpha component [#2313](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2313), and added [CSI 38:6](escape-sequences.md#csi-386-foreground-color-rgba), `CSI 48:6` and `CSI 58:6` extensions to allow setting full color RGB with Alpha channel for spans of text.

* Copy Mode: new default vim-style `y` "yank" key assignment will copy the selection and close copy mode

#### Fixed

* Tab bar could glitch and show incorrect contents when adjusting for monitor or changed font scaling [#2208](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2208)
* Wayland: transparent gap under tab bar when window is transparent, split and using per-pane color schemes [#1620](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1620)
* Tab bar could show a gap to the right when resizing
* Padding could show window background rather than pane background around split panes at certain window sizes [#2210](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2210)
* Loading dynamic escape sequence scripts from the [iTerm2-Color-Scheme dynamic-colors directory](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/dynamic-colors) would only apply the first 7 colors
* Unix: Clicking a URL when no browser is open could cause wezterm to hang until the newly opened browser is closed. [#2245](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2245)
* Quickselect: now selects the bottom-most match rather than the top-most match. [#2250](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2250)
* Mux: `wezterm.mux.set_active_workspace` didn't update the current window to match the newly activated workspace. [#2248](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2248)
* Overlays such as debug and launcher menu now handle resize better
* Shift-F1 through F4 generated different encoding than xterm [#2263](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2263)

Thanks to [@Anomalocaridid](https://github.com/Anomalocaridid)! [#2271](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2271) [#2103](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2103)
* [gui-startup](config/lua/gui-events/gui-startup.md) now passes a [SpawnCommand](config/lua/SpawnCommand.md) parameter representing the `wezterm start` command arguments.
* Tab `x` button is no longer obscured by tab title text for long tab titles [#2269](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2269)
* Cursor position could end up in the wrong place when rewrapping lines and the cursor was on the rewrap boundary [#2162](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2162)
* Two or more panes closing at the same time could result in their containing tab hanging and being stuck with "no pane" for a title [#2304](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2304)
* Visual Bell now fills out to the adjacent window edges rather than being constrained by the padding. [#2364](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2364)

* You may now use `CTRL-n` and `CTRL-p` (in addition to the up/down arrow and vi motion keys) to change the selected row in the Launcher.  Thanks to [@Junnplus](https://github.com/Junnplus)! [#1880](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1880)
* Attaching multiplexer domains now attaches the first window as a tab in the active window, rather than opening a new window. [#1874](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1874)
* [AttachDomain](config/lua/keyassignment/AttachDomain.md) and [DetachDomain](config/lua/keyassignment/DetachDomain.md) key assignments
* Specifying a domain name in a [SpawnCommand](config/lua/SpawnCommand.md) will cause that domain to be attached if it is in the detached state. This is useful when combined with [SwitchToWorkspace](config/lua/keyassignment/SwitchToWorkspace.md).
* X11: wezterm now sets `_NET_WM_NAME` in addition to `WM_NAME` for clients that don't know how to fallback
* [treat_east_asian_ambiguous_width_as_wide](config/lua/config/treat_east_asian_ambiguous_width_as_wide.md) for control over how ambiguous width characters are resolved. [#1888](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1888)

* macOS, Windows, Wayland: you may now drag and drop files from other programs and have their paths paste into the terminal. The new [quote_dropped_files](config/lua/config/quote_dropped_files.md) option controls how the file names are quoted. Thanks to [@junnplus](https://github.com/junnplus), [@datasone](https://github.com/datasone) and [@Funami580](https://github.com/Funami580)! [#1868](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1868) [#1953](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1953) [#2148](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2148)
* The mouse scroll wheel now cycles between tabs when hovering over the tab. Thanks to [@junnplus](https://github.com/junnplus)! [#1726](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1726)
* Holding down `ALT` while dragging the left button will select a rectangular block. It is also possible to use `ALT+SHIFT` to select a rectangular block. [ExtendSelectionToMouseCursor](config/lua/keyassignment/ExtendSelectionToMouseCursor.md) and [SelectTextAtMouseCursor](config/lua/keyassignment/SelectTextAtMouseCursor.md) now accept `"Block"` as a selection mode. Thanks to [@Funami580](https://github.com/Funami580) for helping! [#1361](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1361)
* In Copy Mode, `CTRL-v` will enable rectangular block selection mode. [#1656](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1656)
* In Copy Mode, `SHIFT-v` will enable line selection mode. Thanks to [@bew](https://github.com/bew)! [#2086](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2086)
* In Copy Mode, `o` and `O` can be used to move the cursor to the other end of the selection, as in vim. Thanks to [@bew](https://github.com/bew)! [#2150](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2150)
* Copy Mode: key assignments are [now configurable](copymode.md#configurable-key-assignments) [#993](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/993)
* Search Mode: key assignments are [now configurable](scrollback.md#configurable-search-mode-key-assignments) [#993](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/993)
* Search Mode: the default `CTRL-SHIFT-F` key assignment now defaults to the new `CurrentSelectionOrEmptyString` mode to search for the current selection text, if any.  See [Search](config/lua/keyassignment/Search.md) for more info.
* Copy Mode and Search Mode can be toggled and remember search results and cursor positioning, making it easier to locate and select text without using the mouse [#1592](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1592)
* In the Launcher Menu, you may now use `CTRL-G` to cancel/exit the launcher [#1977](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1977)

* [SplitPane](config/lua/keyassignment/SplitPane.md) key assignment that allows specifying the size and location of the split, as well as top-level (full width/height) splits. `wezterm cli split-pane --help` shows equivalent options you can use from the cli. [#578](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/578)
* [ime_preedit_rendering](config/lua/config/ime_preedit_rendering.md) option to choose whether to use the builtin or the system IME preedit rendering mode. Thanks to [@kumattau](https://github.com/kumattau)! [#2006](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2006)

* [wezterm.GLOBAL](config/lua/wezterm/GLOBAL.md) for persisting lua data across config reloads
* `wezterm show-keys` command to show key and mouse binding assignments [#2134](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2134)

#### Updated
* Bundled harfbuzz to 4.3.0

#### Changed
* Debian packages now register wezterm as an alternative for `x-terminal-emulator`. Thanks to [@xpufx](https://github.com/xpufx)! [#1883](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1883)
* Windows: wezterm will now read the default environment variables from the `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment` and `HKCU\Environment` and apply those to the base environment prior to applying `set_environment_variables`. [#1848](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1848)
* [Key Table](config/key-tables.md) lookups will now keep searching the activation stack until a matching assignment is found, allowing for layered key tables. [#993](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/993)
* Search mode's search term is now remembered per-tab between activations of search mode. [#1912](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1912)
* Quickselect no longer jumps to the bottom of the viewport when activated, allowing you to quickselect within the current viewport region
* Quickselect now supports multi-line anchors such as `^` and `$`.  [#2008](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2008)
* Overriding config using the cli `--config` option will now error out and prevent starting up if unknown config options are specified, or if the value evaluates to `nil`. Unknown options continue to generate warnings (rather than errors) when observed in the config file so that you're not "locked out" of wezterm if you make a typo in the config file.
* Windows: [allow_win32_input_mode](config/lua/config/allow_win32_input_mode.md) now defaults to `true` and enables using [win32-input-mode](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/main/doc/specs/%234999%20-%20Improved%20keyboard%20handling%20in%20Conpty.md) to send high-fidelity keyboard input to ConPTY. This means that win32 console applications, such as [FAR Manager](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager) that use the low level `INPUT_RECORD` API will now receive key-up events as well as events for modifier-only key presses. [#1509](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1509) [#2009](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2009) [#2098](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2098) [#1904](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1904)
* Wayland: [enable_wayland](config/lua/config/enable_wayland.md) now defaults to `true`. [#2104](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2104)
* [exit_behavior](config/lua/config/exit_behavior.md) now defaults to `"Close"`. [#2105](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2105)
* Improved [wezterm.action](config/lua/wezterm/action.md) syntax for slightly more ergnomic and understandable key assignments. [#1150](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1150)

* Windows: uncommitted IME composition could get stuck when switching input methods. [#1922](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1922)
* OSC sequences, such as those that change the window or tab title, that accept a single string parameter will now join multiple parameters together. This allows window and tab titles to contain a semicolon. Thanks to [@kumattau](https://github.com/kumattau)! [#1939](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1939)
* Unable to use `ALT` as a modifier for the `leader` key. [#1958](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1958)
* IME Candidate window position was incorrect. Thanks to [@kumattau](https://github.com/kumattau) and [@aznhe21](https://github.com/aznhe21)! [#1976](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1976) [#2001](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2001) [#2022](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2022)

* Detaching an ssh multiplexer domain sometimes killed the associated panes! [#1993](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1993)
* `DecreaseFontSize` wasn't quite the inverse of `IncreaseFontSize`. Thanks to [@Funami580](https://github.com/Funami580)! [#1997](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1997)
* Wayland: unable to paste text that was copied before starting the initial wezterm window. Thanks to [@Funami580](https://github.com/Funami580)! [#1994](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1994) [#1385](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1385)
* Unicode NFD text could incorrectly render with repeated glyphs [#2032](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2032)
* Windows: spawning new panes/tabs wouldn't automatically use the working directory of the current pane when OSC 7 was not being used [#2036](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2036)

* Added [freetype_pcf_long_family_names](config/lua/config/freetype_pcf_long_family_names.md) option to workaround PCF font naming issues on certain Linux distributions. [#2100](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2100)
* X11/Wayland: wezterm.desktop now specifies `StartupWMClass`. Thanks to [@uncomfyhalomacro](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro)! [#2052](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2052) [#2125](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2125)
* `sudo -i` in a pane would cause subsequent pane/tab creation to fail until the cwd was changed to an accessible directory [#2120](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2120)
* X11: Fixed an issue where some events could get lost around resize events, especially prevalent when using the NVIDIA proprietary drivers. Thanks to [@pjones123](https://github.com/pjones123) and [@yuttie](https://githug.com/yuttie) for working through this! [#1992](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1992) [#2063](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2063) [#2111](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2111) [#1628](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1628)
* macOS: `SHIFT-Tab` and `CTRL-SHIFT-Tab` produced incorrect results [#1902](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1902)
* X11: Fixed an issue where copy and paste between two wezterm windows could produce stale results. [#2110](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2110)
* Mouse selection spanning multiple lines always included the first column even when the mouse was to the left of the first column. Thanks to [@Funami580](https://github.com/Funami580)! [#2106](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/2106)
* Fonts: Codepoints for eg: symbol glyphs that were not explicitly listed in your font fallback list may not be resolved when used in styled (eg: bold) text. [#1913](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1913) [#2158](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/2158)

### 20220408-101518-b908e2dd

#### New
* [Key Tables](config/key-tables.md) feature for powerful modal key assignments
* `wezterm start --position x,y`, `wezterm start --position displayname:30%,30%` option to control starting window position on all systems except for Wayland. See `wezterm start --help` for more info. [#1794](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1794)
#### Changed
* Default key assignments are `mapped:` again. A new [key_map_preference](config/lua/config/key_map_preference.md) option allows the defaults to use `"Mapped"` or `"Physical"`.
* Disabled ligatures for `"Monaco"` and `"Menlo"` fonts, as those have `"fi"` ligatures that match even for words such as `find`. [#1786](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1786) [#1736](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1736)
* Removed the `send_composed_key_when_alt_is_pressed` option. When processing generic `ALT` (eg: that has neither left nor right), if either `send_composed_key_when_left_alt_is_pressed` or `send_composed_key_when_right_alt_is_pressed` is true, then the composed form of the key event will be generated.
#### Updated and Improved
* Bundled harfbuzz to 4.2.0
* On macOS, non-native fullscreen mode now attempts to avoid the notch on systems that have one. [#1737](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1737)
* Sixel parsing performance has been improved
* You may now [specify a scaling factor per fallback font](config/lua/wezterm/font_with_fallback.md#manual-fallback-scaling), which is useful when your preferred CJK font renders smaller than your Roman primary font, for example.
* Color schemes: [Retro](colorschemes/r/index.md#retro), [GitHub Dark](colorschemes/g/index.md#github-dark), [Blazer](colorschemes/b/index.md#blazer)
* Wayland: touchpad scroll is now more responsive/precise. Thanks to [@davidrios](https://github.com/davidrios)! [#1800](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1800) [#1840](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1840)
* Kitty image protocol: now also supports shared memory data transmission. Thanks to [@tantei3](https://github.com/tantei3)! [#1810](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1810)
* Secondary DA response bumped up to persuade vim to set `ttymouse=sgr` by default. [#1825](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1825)

#### Fixed
* Incorrect csi-u encoding with non-ascii characters. [#1746](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1746)
* X11 `_NET_WM_ICON` had red/blue channels swapped [#1754](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1754)
* ls-fonts output didn't quote the `style` field [#1762](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1762)
* `window_decorations = "RESIZE"` on Windows prevented minimize/maximize and aerosnap, double click to maximize, and had an ugly top border. Many thanks to [@davidrios](https://github.com/davidrios)! [#1674](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1674) [#1675](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1675) [#1771](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1771)
* On Windows, explorer shortcut icons with the maximized setting would fall out of maximized state on startup. Thanks to [@davidrios](https://github.com/davidrios)! [#1502](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1502)
* `LANG` environment variable was not always set on macOS, leading to mojibake when entering CJK.  [#1761](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1761) [#1765](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1765)
* Fonts with only non-unicode names (eg: only using a Chinese multibyte string encoding) were treated as having names like `?????` and were not accessible. [#1761](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1761)
* Hover state of leftmost retro style tab was overly sticky when the mouse moved out of the tab. [#1764](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1764)
* On macOS, the font size could incorrectly double or halve after waking from sleep or moving the window to/from an external monitor. [#1566](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1566) [#1745](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1745)
* On Windows, touchpad scrolling was janky. Many thanks to [@davidrios](https://github.coim/davidrios)! [#1773](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1773) [#1725](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1725) [#949](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/949)
* X11: workaround i3-gaps not sending initial CONFIGURE_NOTIFY or FOCUS events, leading to weird initial window size and broken focus status. [#1710](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1710) [#1757](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1757)
* Hyperlink rules with more captures than replacements could panic wezterm when text matched. [#1780](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1780)
* Malformed XTGETTCAP response. [#1781](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1781)
* Multiplexer performance with images was unusable for all but tiny images. [#1237](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1237)
* `CloseCurrentPane{confirm=false}` would leave behind a phantom tab/pane when used with the multiplexer. [#1277](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1277)
* `CloseCurrentPane{confirm=true}` artifacts when used with the multiplexer. [#783](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/783)
* Scrollbar thumb could jump around/move out of bounds. Thanks to [@davidrios](https://github.com/davidrios)! [#1525](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1525)
* OSC 52 could stop working for tabs/panes spawned into the GUI via the CLI. [#1790](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1790)
* Workaround for fonts with broken horizontal advance metrics [#1787](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1787)
* Improved mouse based selection. Thanks to [@davidrios](https://github.com/davidrios)! [#1805](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1805) [#1199](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1199) [#1386](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1386) [#354](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/354)
* X11 `KP_End` wasn't recognized [#1804](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1804)
* fontconfig matches now also treat `"charcell"` spacing as monospace. [#1820](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1820)
* Multiplexer render update laggy, especially when using multiple windows. [#1814](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1814) [#1841](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1841)

### 20220319-142410-0fcdea07

#### New

* [window:composition_status()](config/lua/window/composition_status.md) and [window:leader_is_active()](config/lua/window/leader_is_active.md) methods that can help populate [window:set_right_status()](config/lua/window/set_right_status.md) [#686](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/686)
* You may now use `colors = { compose_cursor = "orange" }` to change the cursor color when IME, dead key or leader key composition states are active.
* Support for SGR-Pixels mouse reporting. Thanks to [Autumn Lamonte](https://gitlab.com/autumnmeowmeow)! [#1457](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1457)
* [ActivatePaneByIndex](config/lua/keyassignment/ActivatePaneByIndex.md) key assignment action. [#1517](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1517)
* Windows: wezterm may now use [win32-input-mode](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/main/doc/specs/%234999%20-%20Improved%20keyboard%20handling%20in%20Conpty.md) to send high-fidelity keyboard input to ConPTY. This means that win32 console applications, such as [FAR Manager](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager) that use the low level `INPUT_RECORD` API will now receive key-up events as well as events for modifier-only key presses. Use `allow_win32_input_mode=true` to enable this. [#318](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/318) [#1509](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1509) [#1510](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1510)
* Windows: [default_domain](config/lua/config/default_domain.md), [wsl_domains](config/lua/config/wsl_domains.md) options and [wezterm.default_wsl_domains()](config/lua/wezterm/default_wsl_domains.md) provide more flexibility for WSL users. The effect of `add_wsl_distributions_to_launch_menu=false` was replaced by `wsl_domains={}`.
* `Symbols Nerd Font Mono` is now bundled with WezTerm and is included as a default fallback font. This means that you may use any of the glyphs available in the [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) collection with any font without patching fonts and without explicitly adding that font to your fallback list. Pomicons have an unclear license for distribution and are excluded from this bundled font, however, you may manually install the font with those icons from the Nerd Font site itself and it will take precedence over the bundled font.  This font replaces the older `PowerlineExtraSymbols` font.  [#1521](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1521).

* Blinking text is now eased rather than binary-blinked. See [text_blink_ease_in](config/lua/config/text_blink_ease_in.md) and [text_blink_ease_out](config/lua/config/text_blink_ease_out.md), [text_blink_rapid_ease_in](config/lua/config/text_blink_rapid_ease_in.md) and [text_blink_rapid_ease_out](config/lua/config/text_blink_rapid_ease_out.md) for more information.

* The default `CompleteSelectionOrOpenLinkAtMouseCursor` left button release assignment now also accepts SHIFT being held in order to make SHIFT-click `ExtendSelectionToMouseCursor` feel more ergonomic if the mouse button is released before the SHIFT key. [#1204](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1204)
* Unicode BIDI and other zero-width graphemes are now filtered out from the terminal model. It's not ideal in the sense that that information is essentially lost when copying to the clipboard, but it makes the presentation correct. [#1422](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1422)
* [use_ime](config/lua/config/use_ime.md) now defaults to `true` on X11 systems

* `wezterm cli --no-auto-start` was not respected
* Pixel geometry configured on the PTY in new windows could be incorrect on HiDPI displays until the window was resized [#1387](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1387)
* Image attachment geometry for imgcat and sixels could stretch the image across the rounded up number of cells that contained the image. [#1300](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1300), [#1270](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1270)
* Closing a split pane created inside a `wezterm ssh` session wouldn't actually close the pane [#1197](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1197)
* Clicking when unfocused could lead to unwanted text selection [#1140](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1140) [#1310](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1310)

* [TLS domains](multiplexing.md) bootstrapping via SSH now use the `libssh` backend by default and work more reliably on Windows
* Closing a window will no longer recursively terminate contained multiplexer client panes; the window will instead be restored when you next connect to that multiplexer server. Killing/closing individual tabs/panes *will* kill the panes; this change only affects closing the window. [#848](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/848) [#917](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/917) [#1224](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1224)

* macOS: certain keys (eg: `F8` and `F9`) did nothing when `use_ime=true`. [#975](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/975)
* Splitting a tab would cause the window to lose its transparency [#1459](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1459)

### 20211205-192649-672c1cc1

#### Fixed

* Windows: `wezterm <something>` would fail silently when spawning `wezterm-gui` under the covers. Regression introduced by [#1278](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1278). Workaround is to directly spawn `wezterm-gui`.

#### New

* X11 now supports IME. It currently defaults to disabled, but you can set `use_ime = true` in your config to enable it (you need to restart wezterm for this to take effect). Many thanks to [@H-M-H](https://github.com/H-M-H) for bringing xcb-imdkit to Rust and implementing this in wezterm! [#250](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/250) [#1043](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1043)
* it is now possible to define colors in the range 16-255 in `colors` and color scheme definitions. Thanks to [@potamides](https://github.com/potamides)! [#841](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/841) [#1056](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1056)
* Added [SendKey](config/lua/keyassignment/SendKey.md) key assignment action that makes it more convenient to rebind the key input that is sent to a pane.
* Added [Multiple](config/lua/keyassignment/Multiple.md) key assignment action for combining multuple actions in a single press.
* Added [use_resize_increments](config/lua/config/use_resize_increments.md) option to tell X11, Wayland, macOS window resizing to prefers to step in increments of the cell size
* [visual_bell](config/lua/config/visual_bell.md) and [audible_bell](config/lua/config/audible_bell.md) configuration options, as well as a [bell](config/lua/window-events/bell.md) event allows you to trigger lua code when the bell is rung. [#3](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/3)

* [canonicalize_pasted_newlines](config/lua/config/canonicalize_pasted_newlines.md) option to help Windows users manage newlines in pastes [#1213](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1213)
* SSH client now uses `libssh` by default. [ssh_backend](config/lua/config/ssh_backend.md) can be used to change this.

* [unicode_version](config/lua/config/unicode_version.md) option and corresponding OSC escape sequences that affects how the width of certain unicode sequences are interpreted.
* macOS: binaries produced by wezterm's CI are now codesigned, which resolves some spurious permission dialogs that affected some users [#482](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/482)

#### Changed

* new default key assignments: CTRL+PageUp and CTRL+Tab activate next tab, CTRL+PageDown and CTRL+SHIFT+Tab activate previous tab. ALT+{1..8} directly select the first through 8th tabs. Thanks to [@friederbluemle](https://github.com/friederbluemle)! [#1132](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1132)
* X11: we now allow matching visuals with >= 8 bits per rgb value. Previously, we only matched exactly 8 bits. This improve compatibility with systems that have the COMPOSITE extension disabled. Thanks to [@shizeeg](https://github.com/shizeeg)! [#1083](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1083)
* The incomplete `Allsorts` shaper was removed.
* Windows: `wezterm-gui.exe` now only grabs the parent process' console handle when spawned from `wezterm.exe`, which prevents some frustrating interactions when launching `wezterm-gui.exe` via `start` in cmd/powershell. [#1278](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/1278)
* AppImage: take care to remove APPIMAGE related environment when spawning child processes. Thanks to [@srevinsaju](https://github.com/srevinsaju)! [#1338](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/1338)

* [use_cap_height_to_scale_fallback_fonts](config/lua/config/use_cap_height_to_scale_fallback_fonts.md) now computes *cap-height* based on the rasterized glyph bitmap which means that the data is accurate in more cases, including for bitmap fonts.  Scaling is now also applied across varying text styles; previously it only applied to a font within an `wezterm.font_with_fallback` font list.

* Fixed: greatly reduce memory consumption when system fallback fonts are loaded [#559](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/559)
* Fixed: Windows: `window_background_opacity` was only taking effect when `window_decorations="NONE"` [#553](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/553)
* Fixed: an issue where wezterm could hang if the process spawned by a pane doesn't quit when asked [#558](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/558)
* Fixed: panic when dismissing the tab navigator [#542](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/542)
* Fixed: font fallback on macOS returns unresolvable `.AppleSymbolsFB` rather than `Apple Symbols`, leading to slowdowns when rendering symbols [#506](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/506)
* Fixed: laggy repaints for large windows particularly on Windows, but applicable to all systems.  Tuned and triple-buffered vertex buffer updates. [#546](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/546)
* Changed: [allow_square_glyphs_to_overflow_width](config/lua/config/allow_square_glyphs_to_overflow_width.md) now defaults to `WhenFollowedBySpace` and applies to more symbol glyphs. [#565](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/565)
* Changed: macOS: `CMD-Q` is now bound by default to [QuitApplication](config/lua/keyassignment/QuitApplication.md)
* New: added [skip_close_confirmation_for_processes_named](config/lua/config/skip_close_confirmation_for_processes_named.md) option which specifies a list of processes for which it is considered safe to allow closing a pane/tab/window without a prompt. [#562](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/562)
* Fixed: triggering the search overlay again while the search overlay is active no longer closes the underlying pane [#572](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/572)
* Fixed: X10 mouse coordinate reporting encoding could produce invalid outputs for large windows. Capped coordinate values to the maximum value that is representable in UTF-8 encoding
* Fixed: font fallback now happens asynchronously from painting [#508](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/508)
* New: added [window:get_selection_text_for_pane](config/lua/window/get_selection_text_for_pane.md) method [#575](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/575)
* Fixed: implicit hyperlink rules, word and line selection now operate on logical lines which means that they deal with wrapped lines outside of the viewport. [#408](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/408)
* New: `wezterm ssh` now supports reading `~/.ssh/config` and overriding options via the command line.  `IdentityFile` and `ProxyCommand` are the two main new supported options.  Read more about it in [ssh](ssh.md).
* Fixed: ssh support will now try all available identities from the SSH agent rather than just the first.
* New: splitting panes in `wezterm ssh` now works like spawning new tabs: the new program is started on the remote host with no additional authentication required.
* Fixed: Multiplexer sessions would fail to bootstrap via ssh because the bootstrap process exited too soon. [#507](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/507)
* Fixed: Windows: we now compile libssh2 against openssl on all platforms to improve overall key and crypto algorithm support
* Fixed: spawning a new tab via the launcher menu failed because it used the pretty printed multiplexer domain label rather than the multiplexer domain name.
* Fixed: macOS: middle mouse button wasn't recognized. Thanks to [@guswynn](https://github.com/guswynn)! [#599](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/599)
* New: added [ActivateLastTab](config/lua/keyassignment/ActivateLastTab.md) key assignment for jumping back to a previously active tab. Thanks to [@alexgartrell](https://github.com/alexgartrell) [#610](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/610)
* Fixed: added missing XTSMGRAPHICS query/response for sixel support [#609](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/609)
* Fixed: avoid showing an error dialog for synthesized `font_rules` when the configuration specifies a font that doesn't have bold/italic variants. [#617](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/617)
* New: mouse cursor hides when keyboard input is sent to a pane, and shows again when the mouse is moved. [#618](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/618)
* Fixed: macOS: CTRL-Tab key combination was not recognized. [#630](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/630)
* Fixed: wezterm-mux-server will now continue running even after all tabs/panes have been closed. [#631](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/631)
* Fixed: macOS: wezterm-gui could linger in the background until the mouse moves after all tabs/panes have closed
* Fixed: when using [line_height](config/lua/config/line_height.md), wezterm now vertically centers the cell rather than padding only the top [#582](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/582)
* Fixed: macOS: in US layouts, `SUPER+SHIFT+[` was incorrectly recognized as `SUPER+SHIFT+{` instead of `SUPER+{` [#601](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/601)
* Fixed: [wezterm.config_dir](config/lua/wezterm/config_dir.md) was returning the config file path instead of the directory!
* New: [wezterm.config_file](config/lua/wezterm/config_file.md) which returns the config file path

### 20210314-114017-04b7cedd

* New: [tab_bar_style](config/lua/config/tab_bar_style.md) allows customizing the appearance of the rest of the tab bar.
* New: animated gif and png images displayed via `wezterm imgcat` (the iTerm2 image protocol), or attached to the window background via [window_background_image](config/appearance.md#window-background-image) will now animate while the window has focus.
* New: added [foreground_text_hsb](config/lua/config/foreground_text_hsb.md) setting to adjust hue, saturation and brightness when text is rendered.
* New: added [ResetFontAndWindowSize](config/lua/keyassignment/ResetFontAndWindowSize.md) key assignment.
* New: added [ScrollByLine](config/lua/keyassignment/ScrollByLine.md) key assignment.
* New: OSC 777 and OSC 9 escapes now generate Toast Notifications. `printf "\e]777;notify;%s;%s\e\\" "title" "body"` and `printf "\e]9;%s\e\\" "hello there"`.  These don't currently pass through multiplexer connections. [#489](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/489).
* New: [exit_behavior](config/lua/config/exit_behavior.md) config option to keep panes open after the program has completed. [#499](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/499)
* New: added `--config name=value` options to `wezterm`, `wezterm-gui` and `wezterm-mux-server`.  The `--front-end`, `--font-locator`, `--font-rasterizer` and `--font-shaper` CLI options have been removed in favor of this new mechanism.
* New: [window:set_config_overrides](config/lua/window/set_config_overrides.md) method that can be used to override GUI related configuration options on a per-window basis. Click through to see examples of dynamically toggling ligatures and window opacity. [#469](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/469) [#329](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/329)
* New: introduced [custom_block_glyphs](config/lua/config/custom_block_glyphs.md) option to ensure that block glyphs don't have gaps. [#433](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/433)
* New: you can now drag the wezterm window via the tab bar
* New: holding SUPER+Drag (or CTRL+SHIFT+Drag) will drag the wezterm window.  Use [StartWindowDrag](config/lua/keyassignment/StartWindowDrag.md) to configure your own binding.
* New: configure [window_decorations](config/lua/config/window_decorations.md) to remove the title bar and/or window border
* New: we now bundle [PowerlineExtraSymbols](https://github.com/ryanoasis/powerline-extra-symbols) as a built-in fallback font, so that you can use powerline glyphs with any font without patching the font.
* New: [window:set_right_status](config/lua/window/set_right_status.md) allows setting additional status information in the tab bar. [#500](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/500)
* New: Search Mode: Added `CTRL-u` key assignment to clear the current search pattern. Thanks to [@bew](https://github.com/bew)! [#465](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/465)
* Fonts: `font_antialias` and `font_hinting` are now deprecated in favor of the new [freetype_load_target](config/lua/config/freetype_load_target.md) and [freetype_load_flags](config/lua/config/freetype_load_flags.md) options.  The deprecated options have no effect and will be removed in a future release.  The new options provide more direct control over how freetype rasterizes text.
* Fonts: when computing default `font_rules` for bold and italic fonts, strip italic and bold components from the family name. eg: if you set `font = wezterm.font("Source Code Pro Medium")` then the `Medium` text will be stripped from the font name used to locate bold and italic variants so that we don't report an error loading a non-sensical `Source Code Pro Medium Bold`. [#456](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/456)
* Fonts: fix a regression where bright windows behind wezterm could "shine through" on the alpha channel, and adjust the tinting operation to avoid anti-aliased dark fringes [#470](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/470) [#491](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/491)
* Fonts: macOS: fix an issue where wezterm could hang when loading a font located via Core Text [#475](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/475)
* Fonts: Changed the default [font_size](config/lua/config/font_size.md) to 12 points. [#517](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/discussions/517)
* Fonts: Updated bundled JetBrainsMono font to version 2.225
* Added `--config-file` CLI option to specify an alternate config file location. [Read more about config file resolution](config/files.md). Thanks to [@bew](https://github.com/bew)! [#459](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/459)
* OSC 52 (Clipboard manipulation) now respects the difference between PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD on X11 systems.
* Fixed an issue where large pastes could result in a hang
* Closing the configuration error window no longer requires confirmation
* Fixed: an issue where the window would be redrawn on mouse move. This was most noticeable as a laggy mouse pointer when moving the mouse across a window running on the nouveau display driver on X11 and Wayland systems
* Fixed: an issue where closing a pane would immediately `SIGKILL` the associated process, rather than sending `SIGHUP`.  Thanks to [@bew](https://github.com/bew)!
* Fixed: line-based mouse selection (default: triple click) now extends forwards to include wrapped lines. [#466](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/466)
* Fixed: the [RIS](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/RIS) escape wasn't clearing the scrollback. [#511](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/511)
* Wayland: fixed opengl context creation issues.  Thanks to [@valpackett](https://github.com/valpackett)! [#481](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/481)
* Wayland: the raw key modifiers are now correctly propagated so that they activate when used with key assignments using the `key = "raw:123"` binding syntax.
* Wayland: fixed window decoration and full screen handling [#224](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/224)
* Wayland: fixed an issue where key repeat processing could "run away" and hang the application
* Windows: the portable .zip file download now includes ANGLE EGL, just like the setup.exe installer has done since version 20201031-154415-9614e117
* Windows: Fixed [ToggleFullScreen](config/lua/keyassignment/ToggleFullScreen.md) so that it once again toggles between full screen and normal placement. [#177](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/177)
* Windows: fix the unexpected default behavior of Ctrl-Alt being converted to AltGr for layouts supporting this key, the previous behavior is still possible by enabling the option [`treat_left_ctrlalt_as_altgr`](config/lua/config/treat_left_ctrlalt_as_altgr.md) (to solve [#392](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/392)). Thanks to [@bew](https://github.com/bew)! [#512](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/512)
* Windows: fixed "Open WezTerm Here" context menu in explorer when used on the root of a drive (eg: `C:\`).  Thanks to [@flyxyz123](https://github.com/flyxyz123)! [#526](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/526) [#451](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/451)
* X11: fix an issue where SHIFT-Enter was not recognized [#516](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/516)
* X11: improved DPI detection for high-DPI displays. [#515](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/515)
* X11: we now load the XCursor themes when possible, which means that the mouse cursor is now generally a bit larger and clearer as well as conforming more with the prevailing style of the desktop environment. [#524](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/524)
* Improved and optimized image processing so that watching videos via [timg - Terminal Image and Video Viewer](http://timg.sh) works better [#537](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/537) [#535](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/535) [#534](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/534)

### 20210203-095643-70a364eb

* Fix cursor position after using iTerm2 image protocol [#317](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/317)
* Fix pixel dimensions after changing the pane size; this was mostly invisible but impacted image scaling when using sixel or iTerm2 image protocols. [#312](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/312)
* Add support for OSC 133 which allows annotating output as `Output`, `Input` (that you typed) and `Prompt` (shell "chrome"). [Learn more about Semantic prompt and OSC 133](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Per_Bothner/specifications/blob/master/proposals/semantic-prompts.md)
* Add [`ScrollToPrompt`](config/lua/keyassignment/ScrollToPrompt.md) key assignment that scrolls the viewport to the prior/next shell prompt emitted using OSC 133 Semantic Prompt escapes.  This assignment is not bound by default.
* Fixed an issue where `SpawnWindow` didn't use the current working directory from the current pane to spawn the new window
* Added `wezterm start --class CLASSNAME` option to specify the window class name under X11 and Windows, or the `app_id` under Wayland.  See `wezterm start --help` for more information.
* Added shell integration for setting OSC 7 (working directory) and OSC 133 (semantic zones) for Zsh and Bash. [See Shell Integration docs](shell-integration.md).
* Added `SemanticZone` as a possible parameter for [SelectTextAtMouseCursor](config/lua/keyassignment/SelectTextAtMouseCursor.md), making it possible to conveniently select complete input or output regions.
* Improved font rendering [#320](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/320) [#331](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/331) [#413](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/413) and changed `font_antialias = "Greyscale"` by default.
* Updated internal harfbuzz shaper to 2.7.2
* Fixed ALT-Escape not sending ESC-ESC [#338](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/338)
* Added `allow_square_glyphs_to_overflow_width = "WhenFollowedBySpace"` option to allow square symbol glyphs to deliberately overflow their specified cell width when the next cell is a space.  Can be set to `Always` to allow overflowing regardless of the next cell being a space, or `Never` to strictly respect the cell width.  The default is `Never`. [#342](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/342)
* macOS: Improved key input when Option is pressed.  Fixed dead key processing when `use_ime=true`. [#357](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/357)
* macOS: Adjusted default dpi to 72 to bring point sizes into alignment with other macOS apps. [#332](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/332)
* Improved font fallback; we now try harder to find a system-provided font for glyphs that are not found in your explicitly configured fonts.
* Revised pty output processing and removed the related `ratelimit_output_bytes_per_second` option
* Workaround Cocoa leaking window position saved state file descriptors to child processes on macOS Big Sur, and Gnome/Mutter doing something similar under X11
* The 256 color cube now uses slightly brighter colors [#348](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/348)
* New: added `line_height` configuration option to scale the computed cell height. The default is `1.0`, resulting in using the font-specified metrics. Setting it to `1.2` will result in a 20% larger cell height.
* macOS: Fixed an issue where hovering over the split between panes could result in wezterm becoming unresponsive [#391](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/391)
* Closing windows and `QuitApplication` will now prompt for confirmation before proceeding with the close/quit.  Added `window_close_confirmation` to control this; valid values are `AlwaysPrompt` and `NeverPrompt`. [#280](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/280)
* Tidied up logging. Previously ERROR level logging was used to make sure that informational things showed up in the stderr stream. Now we use INFO level logging for this to avoid alarming the user.  You can set `WEZTERM_LOG=trace` in the environment to get more verbose logging for troubleshooting purposes.
* Windows: fix an issue where VNC-server-emulated AltGr was not treated as AltGr [#392](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/392)
* X11: fix an issue where keys that produce unicode characters retained SHIFT as a modifier instead of normalizing it away. [#394](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/394)
* Fixed an issue where a symbol-only font would be seen as 0-width and panic wezterm [#404](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/404)
* Tweaked mouse selection: we now round the x-coordinate to the nearest cell which makes it a bit more forgiving if the mouse cursor is slightly to the left of the intended cell start. [#350](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/350)
* Added `selection_word_boundary` option to control double-click word selection boundaries. The default is <tt> \t\n{}\[\]()\"'\`</tt>. [#405](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/405)
* Added support for Curly, Dotted and Dashed underlines.  See [this documentation](faq.md#how-do-i-enable-undercurl-curly-underlines) on the escape sequences how enable undercurl support in vim and nvim. [#415](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/415)
* Fixed an issue where wezterm would spawn processes with `umask 077` on unix systems, rather than the more commonly expected `umask 022`. [#416](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/416)
* macOS: We now ship a Universal binary containing both Intel and "Apple Silicon" architectures
* Setting a really large or really small font scale (using CTRL +/-) no longer causes a panic [#428](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/428)
* Fixed an issue where the mouse wheel wasn't mapped to cursor up/down when the alternate screen was active [#429](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/429)
* Fixed `ToggleFullScreen` not working on macOS and X11.  It still doesn't function on Windows.  `native_macos_fullscreen_mode = false` uses a fast full-screen window on macOS. Set it to `true` to use the slower macOS native "Spaces" style fullscreen mode. [#177](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/177)
* Windows: fix an issue where the initial window size didn't factor the correct DPI when the system-wide display scaling was not 100%. [#427](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/427)
* New: `adjust_window_size_when_changing_font_size` option to control whether changing the font size adjusts the dimensions of the window (true) or adjusts the number of terminal rows/columns (false).  The default is `true`. [#431](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/431)
* macOS: we no longer use MetalANGLE to render the gui; it was short lived as macOS Big Sur now uses Metal in its CGL implementation.  Support for using MetalANGLE is still present if the dylib is found on startup, but we no longer ship the dylib.
* Windows: when pasting text, ensure that the text has CRLF line endings unless bracketed paste is enabled. This imperfect heuristic helps to keep multi-line pastes on multiple lines when using Windows console applications and to avoid interleaved blank lines when using unix applications. [#411](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/411)
* New: [ClearScrollback](config/lua/keyassignment/ClearScrollback.md) now accepts a parameter to control whether the viewport is cleared along with the scrollback. Thanks to [@dfrankland](https://github.com/dfrankland)!
* New: [default_cwd](config/lua/config/default_cwd.md) to specify an alternative current working directory. Thanks to [@dfrankland](https://github.com/dfrankland)!
* New: [CopyTo](config/lua/keyassignment/CopyTo.md) and [PasteFrom](config/lua/keyassignment/PasteFrom.md) actions. [Copy](config/lua/keyassignment/Copy.md), [Paste](config/lua/keyassignment/Paste.md) and [PastePrimarySelection](config/lua/keyassignment/PastePrimarySelection.md) are now deprecated in favor of these new options.
* X11: Mouse-based selection now copies-to and pastes-from the `PrimarySelection` by default. The [CompleteSelection](config/lua/keyassignment/CompleteSelection.md) and [CompleteSelectionOrOpenLinkAtMouseCursor](config/lua/keyassignment/CompleteSelectionOrOpenLinkAtMouseCursor.md) actions now require a parameter to specify the clipboard.
* X11: `SHIFT-CTRL-C` and `SHIFT-CTRL-V` now copy-to and paste from the `Clipboard` by default.  `SHIFT-Insert` pastes from the `PrimarySelection` by default.
* New: Added a new default `CTRL-Insert` key assignment bound to `CopyTo(PrimarySelection)`
* macOS: Windows now have drop-shadows when they are opaque. These were disabled due transparency support was added. Thanks to [Rice](https://github.com/fanzeyi)! [#445](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/445)
* Unix: adjust font-config patterns to also match "dual spacing" fonts such as [Iosevka Term](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/). Thanks to [Leiser](https://github.com/leiserfg)! [#446](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/446)
* New: Added [alternate_buffer_wheel_scroll_speed](config/lua/config/alternate_buffer_wheel_scroll_speed.md) option to control how many cursor key presses are generated by the mouse wheel when the alternate screen is active. The new default for this is a faster-than-previous-releases 3 lines per wheel tick. [#432](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/432)
* macOS: Dead Keys are now processed even when `use_ime=false`.  [More details in the docs](config/keyboard-concepts.md#macos-left-and-right-option-key). [#410](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/410).
* X11: attempt to load cursors from the XCursor.theme resource specified on the root window [#524](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/524)
* Added `file://` URL matching to the default list of implicit hyperlink rules [#525](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/525)

### 20201101-103216-403d002d

* Whoops! fixed a crash on macOS when using multiple windows in the new Metal renderer [#316](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/316)

### 20201031-154415-9614e117

* New: split/pane support! `CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+"` to [SplitVertical](config/lua/keyassignment/SplitVertical.md),
  and `CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+%` to [SplitHorizontal](config/lua/keyassignment/SplitHorizontal.md).
* New: [LEADER](config/keys.md#leader-key) modifier key support
* New: `window_background_opacity` and `window_background_image`
  options to control using background images, transparent windows.
  [More info](config/appearance.md#window-background-image)
* New color schemes: `Dracula+`, `Gruvbox Light`, `MaterialDarker`,
  `Overnight Slumber`, `Popping and Locking`, `Rapture`,
  `jubi`, `nord`.
* New: expanded lua API allows handling URI clicks and keyboard events
  with lua callbacks.  See [wezterm.on](config/lua/wezterm/on.md) docs.
* The GUI layer now normalizes SHIFT state for keyboard processing.
  If a keypress is ASCII uppercase and SHIFT is held then the
  SHIFT modifier is removed from the set of active modifiers.  This
  has implications for your key assignment configuration; previously
  you would write `{key="T", mods="CTRL|SHIFT"}`, after updating to
  this release you need to write `{key="T", mods="CTRL"}` in order
  for your key bindings to take effect.
* Added `show_tab_index_in_tab_bar` option which defaults to true.
  Causes the tab's ordinal index to be prefixed to tab titles.
  The displayed number is 1-based.  You can set
  `tab_and_split_indices_are_zero_based=true` if you prefer the
  number to be zero based.
* On Linux and macOS systems, wezterm can now attempt to guess the current
  working directory that should be set in newly spawned local panes/tabs,
  in case you don't have OSC 7 integration setup in your shell.
* We now bundle *JetBrains Mono* and use it as the default font,
  and add it as a default fallback font.  Similarly, we also
  bundle *Noto Color Emoji* as a default fallback for emoji.
* Added `automatically_reload_config=false` option to disable
  automatic config reloading.  When set to false, you will need
  to manually trigger a config reload (default: `SUPER+R` or
  `CTRL+SHIFT+R`)
* [`CloseCurrentTab`](config/lua/keyassignment/CloseCurrentTab.md)
  now requires a `confirm` parameter.
* Halved the memory usage requirements per Cell in the common
  case (saving 32 bytes per cell), which gives more headroom for
  users with large scrollback.
* Reduced initial GPU VRAM requirement to 2MiB.  Improved texture
  allocation to avoid needing lots of VRAM.
* macOS: Fix issue where new windows would open as Cocoa tabs
  when wezterm was maximized.
* macOS: Fix issue where wezterm wouldn't adjust to DPI changes
  when dragging across monitors or the screen resolution changed
* macOS: Reduced trackpad based scrolling sensitivity; it was
  hyper sensitive in previous releases, and now it is more
  reasonable.
* Fix an issue where EGL failed to initialize on Linux
* If EGL/WGL/OpenGL fail to initialize, we now try to fallback
  to Mesa OpenGL in software render mode.  This should result
  in its llvmpipe renderer being used as a fallback, which
  has improved visuals compared to wezterm's own basic CPU
  based renderer.  (This applies to X11/Wayland and Windows
  systems).
* Setting `front_end="Software"` will try to use the Mesa OpenGL
  software renderer if available (X11/Wayland/Windows).
  The old basic CPU renderer has been removed.
* The multiplexer server has been moved into its own
  `wezterm-mux-server` executable.  You will need to revise
  your `serve_command` configuration.
* Windows: when started in an RDP session, force the use
  of the Mesa software renderer to work around problems with
  RDP GPU emulation.
* Fixed an issue with TLS Multiplexing where bootstrapping
  certificates would usually fail.
* Windows: Fixed an issue that prevented ALT-Space from
  showing the system menu in the window.
* Windows: Fixed dead key handling.  By default dead keys
  behave the same as in other programs and produce diacritics.
  However, setting `use_dead_keys = false` in the config will
  cause dead keys to behave like a regular key; eg: `^` would
  just emit `^` as its own character.
* Windows: Fixed an issue with the `Hide` key assignment;
  it would hide the window with no way to show it again!
  `Hide` now minimizes the window instead.
* macOS: we now use Metal to render the gui, via
  [MetalANGLE](https://github.com/kakashidinho/metalangle)
* Windows: we now prefer to use Direct3D11 to render the
  gui, via [ANGLE](https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/)
  EGL.  The primary benefit of this is that upgrading your
  graphics drivers while you have a stateful wezterm session
  will no longer terminate the wezterm process. Resize
  behavior is not as smooth with ANGLE as the prior WGL.
  If you wish, you can set `prefer_egl = false` to use
  WGL.
* Improved image protocol support to have better render fidelity
  and to reduce VRAM usage when the same image it displayed
  multiple times in the same pane.

### 20200909-002054-4c9af461

* Added support for OSC 1 (Icon Title changing), and changed
  how that interacts with OSC 2 (Window Title changing).
  If you specify OSC 1 as a non-empty string, then that will
  be used for the title of that terminal instance in the GUI.
  Otherwise the Window Title will be reported instead.
* Added missing mappings for Application Keypad keys on Linux
* Workaround an EGL issue where Mesa reports the least-best
  alpha value when enumerating configs, rather than the best
  alpha.  This could lead to incorrect alpha under XWayland
  and failure to initialize EGL and fallbacks to the Software
  renderer in some other cases.
* `enable_wayland` now defaults to `false`; mutter keeps breaking
  client-side window decoration so let's just make it opt-in so
  that the default experience is better.
* Fixed a crash on Linux/X11 when using `wezterm connect HOST`
* Added `tab_max_width` config setting to limit the maximum
  width of tabs in the tab bar.  This defaults to 16 glyphs
  in width.

### 20200718-095447-d2315640

* Added support for DECSET 1004 Focus Reporting to local
  (not multiplexer) terminal sessions.
* Added support for SGR 53/55 which enable/disable Overline style.
  `printf "\x1b[53moverline\x1b[0m\n"`
* Windows: updated bundled openconsole.exe to [efb1fdd](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/commit/efb1fddb991dc1e6b614d1637daca7314a229925)
  to resolve an issue where bold text didn't respect the configured color scheme.
* Added `bold_brightens_ansi_colors` option to allow disabling the automatic
  brightening of bold text.
* Unix: fix an issue where setting the current working directory for a custom
  spawned command would not take effect (thanks @john01dav!)
* Windows: fixed buffering/timing issue where a response to a color query in
  vim could be misinterpreted and replace a character in the editor with the
  letter `g`.
* X11: Improved support for non-24bpp display depths.  WezTerm now tries
  harder to obtain an 8bpc surface on both 16bpp and 30bpp (10bpc) displays.
* Windows: fixed falling back to a simpler OpenGL context if WGL is unable
  to negotiate a robust context.  This is useful on systems with dual
  high/low power GPU hardware where the OpenGL versions for the two GPUs
  are different!
* Color Schemes: synced with [ea2c841](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/commit/ea2c84115d8cff97b5255a7344090902ae669245)
  which includes new schemes: `Adventure`, `Banana Blueberry`, `Blue Matrix`,
  `BlueBerryPie`, `Cyberdyne`, `Django`, `DjangoRebornAgain`, `DjangoSmooth`,
  `DoomOne`, `Konsolas`, `Laser`, `Mirage`, `Rouge 2`, `Sakura`, `Scarlet
  Protocol`, `synthwave-everything`, `Tinacious Design (Dark)`, `Tinacious
  Design (Light)`.

### 20200620-160318-e00b076c

* Fixed default mapping of ambiguous ctrl key combinations (`i`, `m`, `[`, `{`,
  `@`) so that they emit the old school tab, newline, escape etc. values.
  These got broken as part of prototyping CSI-u support a while back.
* Added option to enable CSI-u key encodings.  This is a new mapping scheme
  defined here <http://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/> that disambiguates
  and otherwise enables more key binding combinations.  You can enable this
  setting using `enable_csi_u_key_encoding = true` in your config file.
* Very early support for sixel graphics
* macos: `use_ime` now defaults to false; this is a better out of
  the box experience for most users.
* macos: we now attempt to set a reasonable default LANG environment based
  on the locale settings at the time that wezterm is launched.
* macos: introduce `send_composed_key_when_left_alt_is_pressed` and
  `send_composed_key_when_right_alt_is_pressed` boolean config settings.  Like
  the existing `send_composed_key_when_alt_is_pressed` option, these control
  whether the `Alt` or `Option` modifier produce composed output or generate
  the raw key position with the ALT modifier applied.  The difference from the
  existing config option is that on systems where Left and Right Alt can be
  distinguished you now have the ability to control this behavior
  independently.  The default behavior on these systems is
  `send_composed_key_when_left_alt_is_pressed=false` and
  `send_composed_key_when_right_alt_is_pressed=true` so that the right Alt key
  behaves more like an `AltGr` key and generates the composed input, while the
  Left Alt is regular uncomposed Alt.
* Fonts: fixed an issue where specifying italic or bold in the second parameter
  of `wezterm.font` didn't work as intended or documented
* Improved terminal emulation conformance; added left/right margin support
  and now passes [esctest](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/esctest)
  to a similar degree as iTerm2
* Fixed an issue where unmodified F5+ would use the CSI-u encoded-modifiers
  format, and confused eg: `htop`.
* `ActivateTab` now accepts negative numbers as a way to reference the last
  tab in the Window.  The default assignment for `CTRL+SHIFT+9` and `CMD+9`
  is now `ActivateTab=-1`, which selects the last tab.
* Fixed an issue when applying hyperlink rules to lines that had mixed width
  characters

### 20200607-144723-74889cd4

* Windows: Fixed AltGr handling for European layouts
* X11: Added `PastePrimarySelection` key assignment that pastes the contents
  of the primary selection rather than the clipboard.
* Removed old TOML config file parsing code
* Removed old `arg="something"` key binding parameter.  This was a remnant from
  the TOML based configuration.  You're unlikely to notice this unless you
  followed an example from the docs; migrate instead to using eg:
  `action=wezterm.action{ActivateTab=i-1}` to pass the integer argument.
* Windows: now also available with a setup.exe installer.  The installer
  enables "Open WezTerm Here" in the explorer.exe context menu.
* Added `ClearScrollback` key assignment to clear the scrollback.  This is bound to CMD-K and CTRL-SHIFT-K by default.
* Added `Search` key assignment to search the scrollback.  Read the new
  [scrollback](scrollback.md) section for more information!
* Fixed an issue where ALT+number would send the wrong output for European
  keyboard layouts on macOS and Linux.  As part of this the default behavior
  has changed: we used to force ALT+number to produce ALT+number instead of
  the composed key for that layout.  We now emit the composed key by default.
  You can switch to the old behavior either by explicitly binding those keys
  or by setting `send_composed_key_when_alt_is_pressed = false` in your
  configuration file.
* Windows: the launcher menu now automatically lists out any WSL environments
  you have installed so that you can quickly spawn a shell in any of them.
  You can suppress this behavior if you wish by setting
  `add_wsl_distributions_to_launch_menu = false`.
  [Read more about the launcher menu](config/launch.md#the-launcher-menu)
* Added `ActivateCopyMode` key assignment to put the tab into mouseless-copy
  mode; [use the keyboard to define the selected text region](copymode.md).
  This is bound to CTRL-SHIFT-X by default.

### 20200517-122836-92c201c6

* AppImage: Support looking for configuration in `WezTerm.AppImage.config` and
  `WezTerm.AppImage.home` to support portable thumbdrive use of wezterm on
  linux systems
* We now check the github releases section for updated stable releases and show
  a simple UI to let you know about the update, with links to download/install
  it.  We don't automatically download the release: just make a small REST API
  call to github.  There is no data collection performed by the wezterm project
  as part of this.  We check once every 24 hours.  You can set
  `check_for_updates = false` in your config to disable this completely if
  desired, or set `check_for_updates_interval_seconds` to an alternative update
  interval.
* Added support for OSC 110-119 to reset dynamic colors, improving our support for Neovim.
* Change OSC rendering to use the long-form `ST` sequence `ESC \` rather than
  the more convenient alternative `BEL` representation, which was not
  recognized by Neovim when querying for color information.
* Fixed Shift-Tab key on X11 and Wayland
* WezTerm is now also available to Windows users via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

### 20200503-171512-b13ef15f

* Added the `launch_menu` configuration for the launcher menu
  as described in [Launching Programs](config/launch.md).
* Fixed a crash when reloading a config with `enable_tab_bar=false`
* Fixed missing icon when running under X11 and Wayland
* Wayland client-side-decorations improved and now also render window title
* Implicitly SGR reset when switching alt and primary screen
* Improved config error reporting UI: we now show just a single
  window with all errors rather than one window per failed reload.

### 20200406-151651-5b700e4

* Added lua based configuration.  Reading TOML configuration will be rapidly
  phased out in favor of the more flexible lua config; for now, both are
  supported, but new features may not be available via TOML.
* Added launcher overlay.  Right click the `+` button on the tab bar or
  bind a key to `ShowLauncher` to activate it.  It allows spawning tabs in
  various domains as well as attaching multiplexer sessions that were not
  connected automatically at startup.
* Windows: we now support mouse reporting on Windows native ptys.  For this to
  work, `conpty.dll` and `OpenConsole.exe` must be present alongside `wezterm.exe`
  when starting wezterm.
* Added `initial_rows` and `initial_cols` config options to set the starting
  size of new terminal windows
* Added `hide_tab_bar_if_only_one_tab = true` config option to hide the tab
  bar when the window contains only a single tab.
* Added `HideApplication` key action (defaults to `CMD-H` on macOS only) which
  hides the wezterm application.  This is macOS specific.
* Added `QuitApplication` key action which causes the gui loop to terminate
  and the application to exit.  This is not bound by default, but you may
  choose to assign it to something like `CMD-Q`.
* Added `set_environment_variables` configuration section to allow defining
  some environment variables to be passed to your shell.
* Improved connectivity UI that shows ssh and mux connection progress/status
* Fixed a bug where the baud rate was not applied when opening a serial port
* Added predictive local echo to the multiplexer for higher latency connections
* We now grey out the UI for lagging multiplexer connections
* Set an upper bound on the memory usage for multiplexer connections


### 20200202-181957-765184e5

* Improved font shaping performance 2-3x by adding a shaper cache
* Windows: now has support for TLS based multiplexer connections
* Multiplexer: TLS multiplexer can now be bootstrapped via SSH, and automatically
  manages certificates
* Unix: We now default to spawning shells with the `-l` argument to request a login
  shell.  This is important on macOS where the default GUI environment doesn't
  source a working PATH from the shell, resulting in an anemic PATH unless the
  user has taken care to cover this in their shell startup.  `-l` works to enable
  a login shell in `zsh`, `bash`, `fish` and `tcsh`.  If it doesn't work with your
  shell, you can use the `default_prog` configuration option to override this.
* We now accept `rgb:XX/XX/XX` color syntax for OSC 4 and related escape
  sequences; previously only `#XXXXXX` and named colors were accepted.
* We now accept OSC 104 to reset custom colors to their defaults.
* Added Tab Navigator overlay for folks that hoard tabs; it presents
  an interactive UI for selecting and activating a tab from a vertically
  oriented list.  This is bound to `Alt-9` by default.
* Added support for DEC Origin Mode (`DECOM`) which improves cursor positioning
  with some applications
* Added support for DEC AutoWrap Mode (`DECAWM`) which was previously always on.
  This improves rendering for applications that explicitly disable it.
* We now show a connection status window while establishing MUX and SSH connections.
  The status window is also where any interactive authentication is carried out
  for eg: SSH sessions.
* Improved SSH authentication handling; we now give you a few opportunities to
  authenticate and are now able to successfully authenticate with sites that
  have configured 2-Factor authentication in their server side SSH configuration.
* Fixed an issue where SHIFT-Space would swallow the space key.
* Nightly builds are now available for Linux in [AppImage](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/releases/download/nightly/WezTerm-nightly.AppImage) format.
* Shift+Left Mouse button can now be used to extend the selection to the clicked location.  This is particularly helpful when you want to select something that is larger than the viewport.
* Windows: a single mouse wheel tick now scrolls by the number of positions configured in the Windows system settings (default 3)
* Windows: fixed IME position when the tab bar is enabled
* Windows: removed support for WinPty, which was too difficult to obtain, configure and use.
* Configuration errors now show in a separate window on startup, or when the configuration is reloaded
* Improved reliability and performance of MUX sessions, although they still have room for further improvement


### 20200113-214446-bb6251f

* Added `color_scheme` configuration option and more than 200 color schemes
* Improved resize behavior; lines that were split due to
  the width of the terminal are now rewrapped on resize.
  [Issue 14](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/14)
* Double-click and triple-click and hold followed by a drag now extends
  the selection by word and line respectively.
* The OSC 7 (CurrentWorkingDirectory) escape sequence is now supported; wezterm records the cwd in a tab and that will be used to set the working directory when spawning new tabs in the same domain.  You will need to configure your shell to emit OSC 7 when appropriate.
* [Changed Backspace/Delete handling](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/commit/f0e94084d1df36009b879b06e9cfd2be946168e8)
* Added `MoveTabRelative` for changing the ordering of tabs within a window
  using key assignments `CTRL+SHIFT+PageUp` and `CTRL+SHIFT+PageDown`
* [The multiplexer protocol is undergoing major changes](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/106).
  The multiplexer will now raise an error if the client and server are incompatible.
* Fixed an issue where wezterm would linger for a few seconds after the last tab was closed
* Fixed an issue where wezterm wouldn't repaint the screen after a tab was closed
* Clicking the OS window close button in the titlebar now closes the window rather than the active tab
* Added `use_ime` option to optionally disable the use of the IME on macOS.  You might consider enabling this if you don't like the way that the IME swallows key repeats for some keys.
* Fix an [issue](https://github.com/knsd/daemonize/pull/39) where the pidfile would leak into child processes and block restarting the mux server
* Fix an issue where the title bars of remote tabs were not picked up at domain attach time
* Fixed selection and scrollbar position for multiplexer tabs
* Added `ScrollByPage` key assignment and moved the `SHIFT+PageUp` handling up to the
  gui layer so that it can be rebound.
* X11: a single mouse wheel tick now scrolls by 5 rows rather than 1
* Wayland: normalize line endings to unix line endings when pasting
* Windows: fixed handling of focus related messages, which impacted both the appearance of
  the text cursor and copy and paste handling.
* When hovering over implicitly hyperlinked items, we no longer show the underline for every other URL with the same destination

### 20191229-193639-e7aa2f3

* Fixed a hang when using middle mouse button to paste
* Recognize 8-bit C1 codes encoded as UTF-8, which are used in the Fedora 31 bash prexec notification for gnome terminal
* Ensure that underlines are a minimum of 1 pixel tall
* Reduced CPU utilization on some Wayland compositors
* Added `$WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE` to the start of the config file search path
* Added new font rendering options:

```
font_antialias = "Subpixel" # None, Greyscale, Subpixel
font_hinting = "Full" # None, Vertical, VerticalSubpixel, Full
```

* Early startup errors now generate a "toast" notification, giving you more of a clue about what went wrong
* We now use the default configuration if the config file had errors, rather than refusing to start
* Wayland compositors: Improved detection of display scaling on startup
* Added `harfbuzz_features` option to specify stylistic sets for fonts such as Fira Code, and to control various typographical options
* Added a `window_padding` config section to add padding to the window display
* We now respect [DECSCUSR and DECTCEM](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/7) escape sequence to select between hidden, block, underline and bar cursor types, as well as blinking cursors.  New configuration options have been added to control the appearance and blink rate.
* We now support an optional basic scroll bar.  The scroll bar occupies the right window padding and has a configurable color.  Scroll bars are not yet supported for multiplexer connections and remain disabled by default for the moment.
* Color scheme changes made in the config file now take effect at config reload time for all tabs that have not applied a dynamic color scheme.

### 20191218-101156-bf35707

* Configuration errors detected during config loading are now shown as a system notification
* New `font_dirs` configuration option to specify a set of dirs to search for fonts. Useful for self-contained wezterm deployments.
* The `font_system` option has been split into `font_locator`, `font_shaper` and `font_rasterizer` options.
* Don't allow child processes to inherit open font files on posix systems!
* Disable Nagle's algorithm for `wezterm ssh` sessions
* Add native Wayland window system support

### 20191124-233250-cb9fd7d

* New tab bar UI displays tabs and allows creating new tabs
* Configuration file changes are hot reloaded and take effect automatically on save
* `wezterm ssh user@host` for ad-hoc SSH sessions. You may also define SSH multiplexer sessions.
* `wezterm serial /dev/ttyUSB0` to connect to your Arduino
* `wezterm imgcat /some/image.png` to display images inline in the terminal using the iTerm2 image protocol
* IME support on macOS and Windows systems
* Automatic fallback to software rendering if no GPU is available (eg: certain types of remote desktop sessions)
