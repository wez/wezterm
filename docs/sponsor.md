# Sponsoring

If you use and find wezterm valuable, please consider sponsoring its
development.

Your support helps to validate the time spent so far and encourages me to spend
more time working on it in the future, keeping the project alive and current.

It may not be readily apparent, but maintaining software that runs across
multiple different operating systems and graphical environments is particularly
labor intensive.

Add to that the time it takes to triage and respond to questions and issues on
GitHub and Element, and that's a significant amount of time and energy just to
keep things ticking over, even without adding new features or making
significant improvements.

It feels like a full time job, but with your support, maybe it could
actually be a full time job?

If you are in a position to provide recurring or even a one-time sponsorship,
I would appreciate it.
