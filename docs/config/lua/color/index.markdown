# `Color` object

Color objects can be created by calling
[wezterm.color.parse()](../wezterm.color/parse.md) and may also be
returned by various wezterm functions and methods.

They represent a color that is internally stored in SRGBA.

Color objects have a number of methods that are helpful to
compare and compute other color values, which is helpful
when programmatically generating color schemes.
