## Example

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  keys = {
    { key = 'v', mods = 'SHIFT|CTRL', action = wezterm.action.Paste },
  },

  -- Middle mouse button pastes the clipboard.
  -- Note that this is the default so you needn't copy this.
  mouse_bindings = {
    {
      event = { Up = { streak = 1, button = 'Middle' } },
      mods = 'NONE',
      action = wezterm.action.Paste,
    },
  },
}
