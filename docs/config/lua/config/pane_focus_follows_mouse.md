# `pane_focus_follows_mouse = false`

{{since('20210502-130208-bff6815d')}}

When `pane_focus_follows_mouse = true`, moving the mouse pointer over an
inactive pane will cause that pane to activate; this behavior is known
as "focus follows mouse".

When `pane_focus_follows_mouse = false` (the default), you need to click
on an inactive pane to activate it.
