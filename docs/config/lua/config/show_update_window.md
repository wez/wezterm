# `show_update_window`

When Wezterm checks for an update and detects a new version, this
option controls whether a window is shown with information about the new
available version and links to download/install it.

See [check_for_updates](check_for_updates.md) for more information on
the automatic update checks.

```lua
config.show_update_window = false
```

{{since('nightly')}}

This option no longer has any effect and will be removed in a future release.
