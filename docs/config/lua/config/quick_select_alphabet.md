# quick_select_alphabet

*Since: nightly builds only*

Specify the alphabet used to produce labels for the items
matched in [quick select mode](../../../quickselect.md).

The default alphabet is `"asdfqwerzxcvjklmiuopghtybn"` which
means that the first matching item from the bottom is labelled
with an `a`, the second with `s` and so forth; these are easily
accessible characters in a `qwerty` keyboard layout.

|Keyboard Layout|Suggested Alphabet|
|---------------|------------------|
|`qwerty`       |`"asdfqwerzxcvjklmiuopghtybn"` (this is the default)|
|`qwertz`       |`"asdfqweryxcvjkluiopmghtzbn"`|
|`azerty`       |`"qsdfazerwxcvjklmuiopghtybn"`|
|`dvorak`       |`"aoeuqjkxpyhtnsgcrlmwvzfidb"`|
|`colemak`      |`"arstqwfpzxcvneioluymdhgjbk"`|
