# `line_height = 1.0`

Scales the computed line height to adjust the spacing between successive rows
of text.  The default line height is controlled by the
[font_size](font_size.md) configuration option.  If you feel that your chosen
font feels too vertically cramped then you can set `line_height = 1.2` to
increase the vertical spacing by 20%.  Conversely, setting `line_height = 0.9`
will decrease the vertical spacing by 10%.
