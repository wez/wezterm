## Copy Mode

*since: 20200607-144723-74889cd4*

Copy mode allows you to make selections using the keyboard; no need to reach
for your mouse or trackpad.  Copy mode is similar to [quick select
  mode](quickselect.md) but is geared up for describing selections based on
keyboard control, whereas quick select mode is used to quickly select and
copy commonly used patterns. The [colors](config/appearance.md#defining-your-own-colors)
of the highlighted/selected text can be configured.

The `ActivateCopyMode` key assignment is used to enter copy mode; it is
bound to `CTRL-SHIFT-X` by default.

When copy mode is activated, the title is prefixed with "Copy Mode" and
the behavior of the tab is changed; keyboard input now controls the
cursor and allows moving it through the scrollback, scrolling the viewport
as needed, in a style similar to that of the Vim editor.

Move the cursor to the start of the region you wish to select and press `v` to
toggle selection mode (it is off by default), then move the cursor to the end
of that region.  You can then use `Copy` (by default: `CTRl-SHIFT-C`) to copy
that region to the clipboard.

### Configurable Key Assignments

*Since: 20220624-141144-bd1b7c5d*

The key assignments for copy mode are specified by the `copy_mode` [Key Table](config/key-tables.md).

You may provide your own definition of this key table if you wish to customize
it.

You may use
[wezterm.gui.default_key_tables](config/lua/wezterm.gui/default_key_tables.md)
to obtain the defaults and extend them. In earlier versions of wezterm there
wasn't a way to override portions of the key table, only to replace the entire
table.

The default configuration at the time that these docs were built (which
may be more recent than your version of wezterm) is shown below.

You can see the configuration in your version of wezterm by running
`wezterm show-keys --lua --key-table copy_mode`.
