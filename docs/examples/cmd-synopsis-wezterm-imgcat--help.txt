Output an image to the terminal

Usage: wezterm imgcat [OPTIONS] [FILE_NAME]

Arguments:
  [FILE_NAME]
          The name of the image file to be displayed. If omitted, will attempt
          to read it from stdin

Options:
      --width <WIDTH>
          Specify the display width; defaults to "auto" which automatically
          selects an appropriate size.  You may also use an integer value `N` to
          specify the number of cells, or `Npx` to specify the number of pixels,
          or `N%` to size relative to the terminal width

      --height <HEIGHT>
          Specify the display height; defaults to "auto" which automatically
          selects an appropriate size.  You may also use an integer value `N` to
          specify the number of cells, or `Npx` to specify the number of pixels,
          or `N%` to size relative to the terminal height

      --no-preserve-aspect-ratio
          Do not respect the aspect ratio.  The default is to respect the aspect
          ratio

      --position <POSITION>
          Set the cursor position prior to displaying the image. The default is
          to use the current cursor position. Coordinates are expressed in cells
          with 0,0 being the top left cell position

      --no-move-cursor
          Do not move the cursor after displaying the image. Note that when used
          like this from the shell, there is a very high chance that shell
          prompt will overwrite the image; you may wish to also use `--hold` in
          that case

      --hold
          Wait for enter to be pressed after displaying the image

      --tmux-passthru <TMUX_PASSTHRU>
          How to manage passing the escape through to tmux
          
          [possible values: disable, enable, detect]

      --max-pixels <MAX_PIXELS>
          Set the maximum number of pixels per image frame. Images will be
          scaled down so that they do not exceed this size, unless
          `--no-resample` is also used. The default value matches the limit set
          by wezterm. Note that resampling the image here will reduce any
          animated images to a single frame
          
          [default: 25000000]

      --no-resample
          Do not resample images whose frames are larger than the max-pixels
          value. Note that this will typically result in the image refusing to
          display in wezterm

      --resample-format <RESAMPLE_FORMAT>
          Specify the image format to use to encode resampled/resized images.
          The default is to match the input format, but you can choose an
          alternative format
          
          [default: input]
          [possible values: png, jpeg, input]

      --resample-filter <RESAMPLE_FILTER>
          Specify the filtering technique used when resizing/resampling images.
          The default is a reasonable middle ground of speed and quality.
          
          See
          <https://docs.rs/image/latest/image/imageops/enum.FilterType.html#examples>
          for examples of the different techniques and their tradeoffs.
          
          [default: catmull-rom]
          [possible values: nearest, triangle, catmull-rom, gaussian, lanczos3]

      --resize <WIDTHxHEIGHT>
          Pre-process the image to resize it to the specified dimensions,
          expressed as eg: 800x600 (width x height). The resize is independent
          of other parameters that control the image placement and dimensions in
          the terminal; this is provided as a convenience preprocessing step.
          
          Resizing animated images will reduce the image to a single frame.
          
          The `--resample-filter` and `--resample-format` options give some
          control over the quality of the resizing operation and the image
          format used.

      --show-resample-timing
          When resampling or resizing, display some diagnostics around the
          timing/performance of that operation
