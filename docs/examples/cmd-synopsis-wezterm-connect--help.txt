Connect to wezterm multiplexer

Usage: wezterm connect [OPTIONS] <DOMAIN_NAME> [PROG]...

Arguments:
  <DOMAIN_NAME>
          Name of the multiplexer domain section from the configuration to which
          you'd like to connect

  [PROG]...
          Instead of executing your shell, run PROG. For example: `wezterm start
          -- bash -l` will spawn bash as if it were a login shell

Options:
      --new-tab
          When spawning into an existing GUI instance, spawn a new tab into the
          active window rather than spawn a new window

      --class <CLASS>
          Override the default windowing system class. The default is
          "org.wezfurlong.wezterm". Under X11 and Windows this changes the
          window class. Under Wayland this changes the app_id. This changes the
          class for all windows spawned by this instance of wezterm, including
          error, update and ssh authentication dialogs

      --workspace <WORKSPACE>
          Override the default workspace with the provided name. The default is
          "default"

      --position <POSITION>
          Override the position for the initial window launched by this process.
