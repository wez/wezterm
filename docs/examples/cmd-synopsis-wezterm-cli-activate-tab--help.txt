Activate a tab

Usage: wezterm cli activate-tab [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --tab-id <TAB_ID>
          Specify the target tab by its id

      --tab-index <TAB_INDEX>
          Specify the target tab by its index within the window that holds the
          current pane. Indices are 0-based, with 0 being the left-most tab.
          Negative numbers can be used to reference the right-most tab, so -1 is
          the right-most tab, -2 is the penultimate tab and so on

      --tab-relative <TAB_RELATIVE>
          Specify the target tab by its relative offset. -1 selects the tab to
          the left. -2 two tabs to the left. 1 is one tab to the right and so
          on.
          
          Unless `--no-wrap` is specified, relative moves wrap around from the
          left-most to right-most and vice versa.

      --no-wrap
          When used with tab-relative, prevents wrapping around and will instead
          clamp to the left-most when moving left or right-most when moving
          right

      --pane-id <PANE_ID>
          Specify the current pane. The default is to use the current pane based
          on the environment variable WEZTERM_PANE.
          
          The pane is used to figure out which window contains appropriate tabs

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
