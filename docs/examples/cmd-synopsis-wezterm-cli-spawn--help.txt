Spawn a command into a new window or tab
Outputs the pane-id for the newly created pane on success

Usage: wezterm cli spawn [OPTIONS] [PROG]...

Arguments:
  [PROG]...  Instead of executing your shell, run PROG. For example: `wezterm
             cli spawn -- bash -l` will spawn bash as if it were a login shell

Options:
      --pane-id <PANE_ID>
          Specify the current pane. The default is to use the current pane based
          on the environment variable WEZTERM_PANE. The pane is used to

          Spawn into a new window, rather than a new tab

          program
