## Contributing

Thanks for considering donating your time and energy!  I value any contribution,
even if it is just to highlight a typo.

If you're thinking of helping out, then the following resources may be helpful:

* [WezTerm on GitHub](https://github.com/wez/wezterm)
* [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/discussions)
* [Realtime conversation with wez on Element.io/Gitter](help.md)
* [Building from Source](install/source.md)
* [Where to find things and hacking on wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-wezterm)

I like to think that I have an open mind and I try to be open to ideas,
suggestions and other improvements.  We can discuss in realtime in the Matrix/Gitter
room or we can do it asynchronously via the issue tracker on GitHub.

You needn't be a crack Rust coder; if you spot a typo or feel like you can see
a way to improve these docs or have a talent for design and would like to help
make WezTerm look cooler, I'd also welcome your contribution!
