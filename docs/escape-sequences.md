## Output/Escape Sequences

WezTerm considers the output from the terminal to be a UTF-8 encoded stream of
codepoints.  No other encoding is supported.  As described below, some C1
control codes have both 7-bit ASCII compatible as well as 8-bit
representations.  As ASCII is a compatible subset of UTF-8, the 7-bit
representations are preferred and processed without any special consideration.

The 8-bit values *are* recognized, but only if the 8-bit value is treated as a
unicode code point and encoded via a UTF-8 multi-byte sequence.

### Printable Codepoints

Codepoints with value 0x20 and higher are considered to be printable and are
applied to the terminal display using the following rules:

* Codepoints are buffered until a C0, C1 or other escape/control sequence is encountered,
  which triggers a flush and processing continues with the next step.
* The buffered codepoint sequence is split into unicode graphemes, which means that
  combining sequences and emoji are decoded.  Processing continues for below for
  each individually recognized grapheme.
* If DEC line drawing mode is active, graphemes `j-n`, `q`, `t-x` are translated
  to equivalent line drawing graphemes and processing continues.
* If prior output/actions require it, the cursor position may be moved to a new line
  and the terminal display may be scrolled to make accomodate it.
* An appropriate number of cells, starting at the current cursor position,
  are allocated based on the column width of the current grapheme and are assigned
  to the grapheme.  The current current graphics rendition state (such as colors
  and other presentation attributes) is also applied to those cells.
  If insert mode is active, those cells will be inserted at the current cursor
  position, otherwise they will overwrite cells at the current cursor position.
* The cursor position will be updated based on the column width of the grapheme.

After the graphemes are applied to the terminal display, the rendering portion of
WezTerm will attempt to apply your [font shaping](config/font-shaping.html) configuration
based on runs of graphemes with matching graphic attributes to determine which glyphs
should be rendered from your fonts; it is at this stage that emoji and ligatures are
resolved.

### C0 Control Codes

Codepoints in the range `0x00-0x1F` are considered to be `C0` control codes.
`C0` controls will flush any buffered printable codepoints before triggering
the action described below.

| Seq|Hex |Name|Description|Action |

### C1 Control Codes

As mentioned above, WezTerm only supports UTF-8 encoding.  C1 control codes
have an 8-bit representation as well as a multi-codepoint 7-bit escape sequence.

The 8-bit representation is recognized if the 8-bit value is treated as a
unicode code point and encoded as a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence.  Sending the
8-bit binary value will not be recognized as intended, as those bitsequences
are passing through a UTF-8 decoder.

The table below lists the 7-bit `C1` sequence (which is preferred) as well as the
codepoint value, along with the corresponding meaning.

As with `C0` control codes, `C1` controls will flush any buffered printable
codepoints before triggering the action described below.

|Seq   |Codepoint|Name|Description       |Action|
|----- |---------|----|------------------|------|
|ESC D |0x84     |IND |Index             |Moves the cursor down one line in the same column. If the cursor is at the bottom margin, the page scrolls up|
|ESC E |0x85     |NEL |Next Line         |Moves the cursor to the left margin on the next line. If the cursor is at the bottom margin, scroll the page up|
|ESC H |0x88     |HTS |Horizontal Tab Set|Sets a horizontal tab stop at the column where the cursor is|
|ESC M |0x8D     |RI  |Reverse Index     |Move the cursor up one line. If the cursor is at the top margin, scroll the region down|
|ESC P |0x90     |DCS |Device Control String|Discussed below|
|ESC [ |0x9B     |CSI |Control Sequence Introducer|Discussed below|
|ESC \\|0x9C     |ST  |String Terminator |No direct effect; ST is used to delimit the end of OSC style escape sequences|

### Other Escape Sequences

As these sequences start with an `ESC`, which is a `C0` control, these will
flush any buffered printable codepoints before triggering the associated
action.

|Seq    | Name   | Description         | Action |
|-------|--------|---------------------|--------|
|ESC c  | [RIS](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/RIS.html) | Reset to Initial State | Resets tab stops, margins, modes, graphic rendition, palette, activates primary screen, erases the display and moves cursor to home position |
|ESC 7  | [DECSC](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECSC.html)  | Save Cursor Position| Records cursor position |
|ESC 8  | [DECRC](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECRC.html)  | Restored Saved Cursor Position | Moves cursor to location it had when DECSC was used |
|ESC =  | [DECPAM](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECPAM.html) | Application Keypad  | Enable Application Keypad Mode |
|ESC >  | [DECPNM](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECPNM.html) | Normal Keypad       | Set Normal Keypad Mode |
|ESC (0 |        | DEC Line Drawing character set | Translate characters `j-x` to line drawing glyphs |
|ESC (B |        | US ASCII character set | Disables DEC Line Drawing character translation |
|ESC #8 | [DECALN](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECALN.html) | Screen Alignment Display | Fills the display with `E` characters for diagnostic/test purposes (for vttest) |

### CSI - Control Sequence Introducer Sequences

CSI sequences begin with the `C1` `CSI` sequence, which is either the 7-bit
`ESC [` sequence or the codepoint `0x9B`.

WezTerm classifies these sequences into a number of functional families which
are broken out below.

#### Graphic Rendition (SGR)

SGR sequences are of the form `CSI DIGITS [; DIGITS ]+ m`.  That is, any number
of semicolon separated numbers, terminated by the `m` codepoint.  There are a handful
of slightly more modern sequences that use colon `:` codepoints to encode additional
context.

The digits map to one of the codes in the table below, which manipulate the
presentation attributes of subsequently printed characters.

It is valid to omit the code number; for example `CSI m` is equivalent to `CSI
0 m` which resets the presentation attributes.

|Code|Description|Action|
|--- |-----------|------|
|0   |Reset      |Reset to default foreground/background colors, reset all presentation attributes, clear any explicit hyperlinks| 
|1   |IntensityBold|Set the intensity level to Bold.  This causes subsequent text to be rendered in a bold font variant and, if the foreground color is set to a palette index in the 0-7 range, effectively shifts it to the brighter value in the 8-15 range|
|2   |IntensityDim|Set the intensity level to Dim or Half-Bright.  This causes text to be rendered in a lighter weight font variant|
|3   |ItalicOn|Sets the italic attribute on the text, causing an italic font variant to be selected|
|4   |UnderlineOn|Text will have a single underline|
|4:0 |UnderlineOff|Text will have no underline|

|5   |BlinkOn|Indicates that the text should blink <150 times per minute|
|6   |RapidBlinkOn|Indicates that the text should blink >150 times per minute|
|7   |InverseOn|Causes the foreground and background colors to be swapped|
|8   |InvisibleOn|Marks text as invisible.|
|9   |StrikeThroughOn|Text will be rendered with a single line struck through the middle|

|53  |OverlineOn|Renders text with a single overline/overbar|
|55  |OverlineOff|Cancels OverlineOn|
|59  |UnderlineColorDefault|Resets the underline color to default, which is to match the foreground color|

|107  |BackgroundBrightWhite|Sets the background color to Bright White, which is palette index 15|

There are a handful of additional SGR codes that allow setting extended colors;
unlike the codes above, which are activated by a single numeric parameter out
of SGR sequence, these the extended color codes require multiple parameters.
The canonical representation of these sequences is to have the multiple
parameters be separated by colons (`:`), but for compatibility reasons WezTerm
also accepts an ambiguous semicolon (`;`) separated variation.  The colon form
is unambiguous and should be preferred; the semicolon form should not be used
by new applications and is not documented here in the interest of avoiding
accidental new implementations.

##### CSI 38:5 - foreground color palette index

This sequence will set the *foreground color* to the specified palette INDEX,
which can be a decimal number in the range `0-255`.

```
CSI 38 : 5 : INDEX m
```

##### CSI 48:5 - background color palette index

This sequence will set the *background color* to the specified palette INDEX,
which can be a decimal number in the range `0-255`.

```
CSI 48 : 5 : INDEX m
```

##### CSI 58:5 - underline color palette index

This sequence will set the *underline color* to the specified palette INDEX,
which can be a decimal number in the range `0-255`.

```
CSI 58 : 5 : INDEX m
```

##### CSI 38:2 - foreground color: RGB

This sequence will set the *foreground color* to an arbitrary color in RGB
colorspace.  The `R`, `G` and `B` symbols below are decimal numbers in the
range `0-255`.  Note that after the `2` parameter two colons are present; its
really an omitted *colorspace ID* parameter but that nature of that parameter
is not specified in the accompanying ITU T.416 specification and is ignored by
`WezTerm` and most (all?) other terminal emulators:

```
CSI 38 : 2 : : R : G : B m
```

(*Since 20210814-124438-54e29167*) For the sake of compatibility with some other
terminal emulators this additional form is also supported where the colorspace
ID argument is not specified:

```
CSI 38 : 2 : R : G : B m
```

##### CSI 38:6 - foreground color: RGBA

*Since: 20220807-113146-c2fee766*

This is a wezterm extension: wezterm considers colorspace ID `6` as RGBA,
allowing you to specify the alpha channel in addition to the RGB channels.

```
CSI 38 : 6 : : R : G : B : A m
```

##### CSI 48:2 - background color: RGB

This sequence will set the *background color* to an arbitrary color in RGB colorspace.
The `R`, `G` and `B` symbols below are decimal numbers in the range `0-255`:

```
CSI 48 : 2 : : R : G : B m
```

(*Since 20210814-124438-54e29167*) For the sake of compatibility with some other
terminal emulators this additional form is also supported where the colorspace
ID argument is not specified:

```
CSI 48 : 2 : R : G : B m
```

##### CSI 48:6 - background color: RGBA

*Since: 20220807-113146-c2fee766*

This is a wezterm extension: wezterm considers colorspace ID `6` as RGBA,
allowing you to specify the alpha channel in addition to the RGB channels.

```
CSI 48 : 6 : : R : G : B : A m
```

##### CSI 58:2 - underline color: RGB

This sequence will set the *underline color* to an arbitrary color in RGB colorspace.
The `R`, `G` and `B` symbols below are decimal numbers in the range `0-255`:

```
CSI 58 : 2 : : R : G : B m
```

(*Since 20210814-124438-54e29167*) For the sake of compatibility with some other
terminal emulators this additional form is also supported where the colorspace
ID argument is not specified:

```
CSI 58 : 2 : R : G : B m
```

##### CSI 58:6 - underline color: RGBA

*Since: 20220807-113146-c2fee766*

This is a wezterm extension: wezterm considers colorspace ID `6` as RGBA,
allowing you to specify the alpha channel in addition to the RGB channels.

```
CSI 58 : 6 : : R : G : B : A m
```

#### Cursor Movement

#### Editing Functions

#### Mode Functions

*Since: 20210814-124438-54e29167*

WezTerm supports [Synchronized Rendering](https://gist.github.com/christianparpart/d8a62cc1ab659194337d73e399004036).
DECSET 2026 is set to batch (hold) rendering until DECSET 2026 is reset to flush the queued screen data.

#### Device Functions

#### Window Functions

### DCS - Device Control String

The `C1` `DCS` escape places the terminal parser into a device control mode until the `C1` `ST` is encountered.

In the table below, `DCS` can be either the 7-bit representation (`ESC P`) or the 8-bit codepoint (`0x90`).

|Seq     | Name  | Description         |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
|DCS $ q " p ST | [DECRQSS](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECRQSS.html) for [DECSCL](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECSCL.html) | Request Conformance Level; Reports the conformance level |

|DCS 1000 q | tmux control mode | Bridges tmux into the WezTerm multiplexer.  Currently incomplete, see [this issue](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/336) for status. |

### Operating System Command Sequences

Operating System Command (OSC) sequences are introduced via `ESC ]` followed by
a numeric code and typically have parameters delimited by `;`.  OSC sequences
are canonically delimited by the `ST` (String Terminator) sequence, but WezTerm
also accepts delimiting them with the `BEL` control.

The table below is keyed by the OSC code.

|OSC|Description|Action|Example|
|---|-----------|------|-------|
|0  |Set Icon Name and Window Title | Clears Icon Name, sets Window Title. | `\x1b]0;title\x1b\\` |
|1  |Set Icon Name | Sets Icon Name, which is used as the Tab title when it is non-empty | `\x1b]1;tab-title\x1b\\` |
